The NI is a figure out of 5, grading the nerdiness of the post and the minimum nerdiness of the reader. Below is a handy table:
0/5 – Completely un-nerdy. Never programmed your VCR or PVR before? Not sure what a PVR is? You’re at the right place. 1/5 – Ever so slightly nerdy. You’ve received and successfully opened “e-mail” before. 2/5 – You’re normal, with slight nerdy tendencies that you possibly try to suppress or just to hide. You surf the web often. You use a smartphone, such as a Blackberry or, common sense forbid, an iPhone, that you use regularly. 3/5 – When you see a pocket-protector, or spectacles that have been mended with a plaster, you feel a strange excited stirring that you’re not able to put a finger on. You get all enthusiastic when some new gadget is released, or when a colleague shows you their new Android telephone syncing their stuff with Google and showing all their NI &amp;gt;3 friends moving in real-time on a neat map of the city. 4/5 – You program stuff. When you’re in the neighbourhood, technical sh*t just starts to work. You read blogs. You know and possibly regularly operate an RSS aggregator. You’ve comfortable in at least two different operating systems. You have your own blog. 5/5 – You speak a few words of Klingon. Linux has no mysteries, you’ve even contributed little bits of the current kernel code. When someone mentions Seven-of-Nine, you get ALL WORKED UP.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>The WHV-NI is used to classify posts, and help you to decide if you want to read or not.

You can&amp;rsquo;t see the first LiveJournal post from May 2001 anymore, but you can see its ported version on this blog.
It seems that I was using Blogger before that - I&amp;rsquo;ve recovered some of those posts and ported them here. See the February 27, 2001 post here.
Wayback Machine has snapshots of this site going as far back as November 27, 1999.

<p>After the blogger / LJ era, the blog spent some time as a Movable Type
instance, then got on board the WordPress train shortly after it was
introduced in 2003, and more recently <a href="/2019/03/31/wordpress-to-hugo/">it became a static site again, this
time using Hugo</a>.</p>
