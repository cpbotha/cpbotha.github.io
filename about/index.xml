The NI is a figure out of 5, grading the nerdiness of the post and the minimum nerdiness of the reader. Below is a handy table:
0/5 – Completely un-nerdy. Never programmed your VCR or PVR before? Not sure what a PVR is? You’re at the right place. 1/5 – Ever so slightly nerdy.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>The WHV-NI is used to classify posts, and help you to decide if you want to read or not. The NI is a figure out of 5, grading the nerdiness of the post and the minimum nerdiness of the reader.  Below is a handy table:</p>
<ul>
<li>0/5 – Completely un-nerdy. Never programmed your VCR or PVR before? Not sure what a PVR is? You’re at the right place.</li>
<li>1/5 – Ever so slightly nerdy. You’ve received and successfully opened “e-mail” before.</li>
<li>2/5 – You’re normal, with slight nerdy tendencies that you possibly try to suppress or just to hide. You surf the web often. You use a smartphone, such as a Blackberry or, common sense forbid, an iPhone, that you use regularly.</li>
<li>3/5 – When you see a pocket-protector, or spectacles that have been mended with a plaster, you feel a strange excited stirring that you’re not able to put a finger on. You get all enthusiastic when some new gadget is released, or when a colleague shows you their new Android telephone syncing their stuff with Google and showing all their NI &gt;3 friends moving in real-time on a neat map of the city.</li>
<li>4/5 – You program stuff. When you’re in the neighbourhood, technical sh*t just starts to <em>work</em>. You read blogs. You know and possibly regularly operate an RSS aggregator. You’ve comfortable in at least two different operating systems. You have <em>your own blog</em>.</li>
<li>5/5 – You speak a few words of Klingon.  Linux has no mysteries, you’ve even contributed little bits of the current kernel code. When someone mentions Seven-of-Nine, you get ALL WORKED UP.</li>
</ul>

You can&amp;rsquo;t see the first LiveJournal post from May 2001 anymore, but you can see its ported version on this blog.
It seems that I was using Blogger before that - I&amp;rsquo;ve recovered some of those posts and ported them here. See the February 27, 2001 post here.

<p>Wayback Machine has snapshots of this site going as far back as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991127081129/http://www.cpbotha.net/">November 27,
1999</a>. It
looks like I embedded the blogger feed on my site as

<p>After the blogger / LJ era, the blog spent some time as a Movable Type
instance, then got on board the WordPress train shortly after it was
introduced in 2003, and more recently <a href="/2019/03/31/wordpress-to-hugo/">it became a static site again, this
time using Hugo</a>.</p>
