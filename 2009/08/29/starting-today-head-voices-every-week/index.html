You can also add other academics as your friends, harr harr.</p><p>What I like most about the software, is the ease with which I can now add new references, and also the fantastic built-in PDF reader, which which I can easily annotate PDFs.  What I don’t like, is that it doesn’t yet offer a way for me to use it on multiple machines where I already have synchronised PDF directories.  For now I’m using it to synchronise a subset of my PDF articles (only collections that I’m currently working on) as that still fits in 500MB, but I’d really like to be able to use it across different machines with my own pre-synched directories.  I did add a <a href=http://feedback.mendeley.com/pages/4941-mendeley-feedback/suggestions/301592-pdfs-should-be-attached-with-paths-relative-to-a-user-configurable-base-path title="Mendeley suggestion w.r.t. pre-synched directories">suggestion</a> concerning this to their feedback thingy.</p><p>I’m going to be using it as my main reference manager for a while (I’ve been using JabRef up to now), primarily because it has 90% of what I need in one system.  If you have a Mendeley account, link up with <a href=http://www.mendeley.com/profiles/charl-botha/ title="cpbotha Mendeley profile">my profile</a> man!</p><p><a href=http://www.mendeley.com/profiles/charl-botha><img alt="Academic research" border=0 src=http://www.mendeley.com/embed/icon/1/blue/big></a></p><p>That’s it for now boys and girls.  I hope you enjoyed the first weekly head voices, and I hope you have a fabulous week! I’ll see you at its other end harr harr!</p></div><footer class=article-footer><ul class=article-tag-list><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/festivals>festivals</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/life>life</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/lowlands>lowlands</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/mendeley>mendeley</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/weekly-head-voices>weekly head voices</a></li></ul></footer></div><nav id=article-nav><a href=/2009/09/05/weekly-head-voices-for-week-36/ id=article-nav-newer class=article-nav-link-wrap><div class=article-nav-title><span>&lt;</span>&nbsp;
