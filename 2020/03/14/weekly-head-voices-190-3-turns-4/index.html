The zig-zag path was
still mostly closed off, so I had to run in circles, which is probably ok,
because that's how life is.</figcaption></figure><p>Welcome back friends to the Weekly Head Voices!</p><p>This is the 190th edition, covering the two weeks from monday February 24 to
Sunday March 8, 2020.</p><p>(I had made a good start on the post on March 8, but then the work week and a
bunch of homing missile deadlines hit. As I write this bit, it is Saturday
March 14, 14:30 SAST.)</p><h2 id=gou-3-turns-4>GOU #3 turns 4!</h2><p>Our third Genetic Offspring Unit, creative named GOU #3, fairly recently
completed another year of life.</p><p>She has now collected the grand total of 4.</p><p>It was a pleasure celebrating her birthday with her as it felt like this was
the first time that she was intellectually fully present.</p><p>With apparent ease she even understood the sometimes tricky concept of having
one&rsquo;s party on a different day than one&rsquo;s birthday.</p><p>For future us, I would also like to note that her pronunciation and sentence
construction are growing more and more precise, sometimes even overly so, the
observation of which delights me.</p><p>GOU#3, if you read this years and years in the future: We can already see that
you are an amazing human being. We are deeply happy that you have come here to
join our clan.</p><h2 id=new-pair-of-altras-acquired>New pair of Altras acquired.</h2><p>In an unexpected but quite happy turn of events, it is starting to look like I
might have to take part in a trail run in July.</p><p>(Charl from the future: Only if my finicky ankles man up between now and then.)</p><p>Once I&rsquo;ve actually done it, and I&rsquo;m still able to tell the tale, I will surely
do so.</p><p>Because I am one of the World&rsquo;s Worst Trail Runners, I will definitely have to
step up my training between now and then.</p><p>As with many other endeavours in life, an important component of all of this is
acquiring suitable shoes.</p><p>Because <a href=/2019/09/09/weekly-head-voices-177-streakers/>my giant-toe-box-zero-drop
Escalantes</a> have been treating
me very well, I had soon narrowed it down to any one of the Altra trail shoes:
Superiors (minimalist), Lone Peaks (jack-of-all-trades), Timp (sightly more
support) and Olympus (maximalist-ish).</p><p>After having read all of the internet regarding the different Altra trail
shoes, I reluctantly came to the conclusion that none of them really knocked it
out of the park.</p><p>Anyways, one Sunday I walked into our local sports super store (I&rsquo;m sorry my
fellow nerds), and it so happened that they had a pair of Lone Peak 4.5s in my
size: GINORMOUS CLOWN SHOE SIZE.</p><p>Trying them on, I tripped and fell right into the psychological black hole of
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases>biases</a> and
<em>instantly</em> convinced myself that these were the shoes for me.</p><p>Fast forward a week of calling my behavioural insurer (starts with a Disco ends
with a Y) every single day, and they finally managed to figure out what was
wrong somewhere deep in their unfortunately quite sub-par IT systems, and
flipped the <a href=https://www.discovery.co.za/vitality/fitness-booster-shoe>Shoe Purchase Gamification
switch</a>.</p><p>In short, if you are able to activate this feature (you have to be super
patient and a bit stubborn), said insurer will subsidise the purchase of a pair
of running shoes based on how often you exercise every week.</p><p>This is one neat way of making your running addiction work for you, if you can
somehow absorb the possibly substantial startup cost, i.e. the hours you have
to spend on the phone with the friendly support agents.</p><p>Behold my beautiful new trail running shoes:</p><figure><a href=https://cpbotha.net/2020/03/14/weekly-head-voices-190-3-turns-4/altra_lonepeak_4.5.jpg><img sizes="(min-width: 35em) 1200px, 100vw" srcset='https://cpbotha.net/2020/03/14/weekly-head-voices-190-3-turns-4/altra_lonepeak_4.5_hucec0c9a6b58409819fadf530fa62e125_2510569_480x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 480w

Runner.</figcaption></figure><h2 id=crabby-wallet>Crabby Wallet!</h2><p>After years of eyeing Fido U2F and FIDO2 hardware security keys on the
internet, I finally took the plunge and acquired <a href=https://www.yubico.com/product/security-key-nfc-by-yubico>a Yubico Security Key
NFC</a>.</p><p>Up to now I used mostly the LastPass Authenticator app and more recently Authy
to generate OTPs as second factor (2FA) for most of my important accounts.</p><p>(BTW, if you&rsquo;re not yet using 2FA for your important accounts, such as email,
now is the best time to upgrade. I would recommend getting <a href=https://authy.com/>the Authy
app</a> because it optionally supports multi-device
synchronization.)</p><p>The YubiCo hardware device is supposed to be more secure than authenticator
apps due to domain hashing, and it&rsquo;s pretty cool that you don&rsquo;t have to copy
across 6-digit codes, but what I didn&rsquo;t foresee as clearly was the following
simple difference:</p><p>I almost always have my phone with me. However, I don&rsquo;t always have my keyring
with me.</p><p>I set out to find a new wallet to replace my already pretty minimalist fake
leather credit card booklet. The new wallet had to be at least as minimalist,
but it had to have some sort of lanyard to which I could attach the security
key.</p><p>I was delighted to discover that (of course) there&rsquo;s a whole community of
minimalist wallet enthusiasts on the internet.</p><p>I was even more delighted when I discovered that the Crabby Wallet C3, a
second-generation product of a <a href=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1369622196/the-crabby-wallet-a-wallet-that-is-not-for-everyon>super successful 2015
kickstarter</a>,
was available all the way down here!</p><p>Behold the minimalist wonder that is my new Crabby Wallet:</p><figure><a href=https://cpbotha.net/2020/03/14/weekly-head-voices-190-3-turns-4/crabby_wallet_c3_canvas.jpg><img sizes="(min-width: 35em) 1200px, 100vw" srcset='https://cpbotha.net/2020/03/14/weekly-head-voices-190-3-turns-4/crabby_wallet_c3_canvas_hu1f536da3a64b778d7ea385a166b464bb_1978542_480x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 480w

As you can see, it's only slightly larger than a credit
card. It's made of canvas which looks pretty durable. After a breaking-in
period, it easily holds up to 10 cards. Sometimes there's even cash stashed
under the rubber-band.</figcaption></figure><p>(Charl from 6 days in the future writes: This looks like it&rsquo;s going to be a
keeper. It&rsquo;s more compact and more secure than my previous credit card booklet,
and it has become much more ergonomic after the initial break-in period.)</p><h2 id=the-end-of-this-post>The end of this post.</h2><p>Thank you for connecting with me here!</p><p>Remember, it&rsquo;s now Saturday March 14, 15:26 SAST, but this post will forever
