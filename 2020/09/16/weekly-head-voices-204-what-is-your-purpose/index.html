for two days of the week with the school in COVID-19-mode.</p><p>On other days we get to sleep in until 6:45. LUXURY!</p><p>(The lock-down also saved us from a few months of 5:45 wake-ups 5 time per
week during the darkest part of the winter, so there&rsquo;s that.)</p><p>This, together with increased pressure at work, has again brought into sharp
focus my sleep hygiene.</p><p>I haven&rsquo;t been doing too badly during the past months, but the current period
seemed to require a tad more attention to good sleep.</p><p>After reading the disappointing news that the promised first-party (Apple, in
other words) sleep-tracking in the new WatchOS 6 release was not going to be
much more than tracking time in bed, I searched around for the best third-party
sleep tracking app.</p><p>Well folks, after a few weeks of testing, I think that <a href=http://autosleep.tantsissa.com/>AutoSleep</a> is it!</p><p>(Beware, there&rsquo;s a straight rip-off app in the Google Play store. It&rsquo;s not even
in the same reality as the real thing, although the scammers have stolen a
bunch of visual elements and even copy from the real autosleep website. Oh
Android&mldr;)</p><p>The app appears to be almost too full of complicated-looking visual gizmos, so
much so that initially I was not as positive about it. See below for an example
of my sleep history overview:</p><figure><a href=autosleep_screenshot.png><img sizes="(min-width: 35em) 1200px, 100vw" srcset='https://cpbotha.net/2020/09/16/weekly-head-voices-204-what-is-your-purpose/autosleep_screenshot_huce0efa54e288cea4a99599142a3b63a7_817330_480x0_resize_box_3.png 480w,' src=https://cpbotha.net/2020/09/16/weekly-head-voices-204-what-is-your-purpose/autosleep_screenshot.png width=240px></a></figure><p>However, after using it for a while, and coming to grips with the various
pieces of feedback, this app has turned out to be a great tool in my quest for
sleep hygiene nirvana.</p><p>Furthermore, I did have to change my watch charging habits by charging my watch
in the evening hours, so that I can sleep with it on my wrist, and I also have
to remember to tap the &ldquo;lights out&rdquo; button when I attempt to start my sleep
(you don&rsquo;t have to do this, but it gives more accurate tracking that way).</p><p>Now I have measurements to show how important the wind-down routine is (if I
can fit in some book-reading in bed, I can fall asleep after that in almost no
time); how some nights when it feels like I&rsquo;m quite restless, I actually do get
quite an amount of sleep; and finally how a drink or two on a weekend night can
affect my average heart rate through the night (+5 beats, oof), and more.</p><h2 id=wsl2-and-nativecomp-emacs-workflow-update>WSL2 and nativecomp Emacs workflow update</h2><p>The following is for my more nerdy readers.</p><p>After running into <a href=https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/4619#issuecomment-678652118>this comment</a> on a github issue I am subscribed to, I learned
that you can use the versatile <a href=http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/>socat</a> tool to forward connections from a unix
socket on WSL2, via the WSL bridge and a WSL1 instance, to a TCP port on
localhost.</p><p>The upshot of this is that I now have a robust X11 connection from WSL2 to X410
running on my Windows laptop.</p><p>This is possible without socat, but you either need to forward ports using SSH
(which I&rsquo;ve done), or punch holes in the firewall, and then, as if that&rsquo;s not
bad enough, deal with a connection that breaks every time the laptop goes into
suspend.</p><p>With the socat X11 connection in place, I decided that it was time to go
further around the WSL2 bend and replace my complicated rsync-based scripts for
copying source code from the Windows host to the WSL2-native filesystem with a
second instance of dropbox running directly on WSL2, with a severe selective
sync configuration.</p><p>By the way, after <a href=https://dropbox.tech/infrastructure/rewriting-the-heart-of-our-sync-engine>Dropbox rewrote their sync engine (in Rust)</a>, nothing else
even comes close in terms of performance.</p><p>Thanks to this perfect storm of socat-X11-boosted WSL2 and MULTI-dropbox, I
decided that it was finally time to commit to <a href=https://akrl.sdf.org/gccemacs.html>the new nativecomp Emacs &ldquo;capable
of compiling and running Emacs Lisp as native code&rdquo;</a>, so I busted out my
slightly modified version of <a href=https://masteringemacs.org/article/speed-up-emacs-libjansson-native-elisp-compilation>Mickey Petersen&rsquo;s</a> Dockerfile and compiled me one.</p><p>This very post is being written on native-compiled Emacs Lisp, running on WSL2,
displaying via socat to X410.</p><p><code>#feelsgoodman</code></p><p>(P.S. I&rsquo;ve been running like this for about three weeks, with nary an
issue. The future is now.)</p><h2 id=keyboard-update-unicorns-with-rgb>Keyboard update: Unicorns-with-RGB</h2><p>You might remember from <a href=/2020/07/19/weekly-head-voices-200-we-are-extremely-pleased-to-be-here/#my-attempt-at-dipping-my-toes-carefully-into-the-world-of-mechanical-keyboards>WHV #200 how I carefully started dipping my toes in the
clickity-clackety waters of mechanical keyboards</a> by acquiring a cheap keyboard
with hot-swappable <a href=https://input.club/the-comparative-guide-to-mechanical-switches/tactile-clicky/outemu-blue/>Outemu blue switches</a>.</p><p>What I did not tell you then, was that shortly after acquiring that keyboard, I
had already ordered the <a href=https://youtu.be/e9gRESbY-e8>Womier K87 all-acrylic RGB-overload keyboard</a> from
Banggood.</p><p>My reason for ordering that specific board was not so much the lighting (WHICH
IS FREAKING SPECTACULAR BUT BACK THEN I DID NOT KNOW THIS), but rather because
it was the most affordable mechanical keyboard with universal(-ish)
hotswappable switches.</p><p>You see, the Outemu board can only take Outemu switches, while with a board
with universal sockets, you have access to a whole smorgas(key)bord of
different switches!</p><p>The Womier finally arrived after slightly more than a month, with <a href=https://input.club/the-comparative-guide-to-mechanical-switches/tactile/gateron-brown/>Gateron brown
switches</a> installed as I had requested.</p><p>Probably due to both the brown switches (rated 45g actuation force but probably
less, tactile but not clicky) and due to the board&rsquo;s far more solid
composition, my typing comfort and speed on this thing are close to what I
usually have on my Microsoft Sculpt ergonomic.</p><p>Because of this, I don&rsquo;t swap back to the Sculpt nearly as often.</p><p>Together with the fact that the keyboard has an impressive and varied
collection of intricate animated lighting patterns thanks to the RGB LED behind
each and every single key, and a whole bunch of extra LEDs in the acrylic body,
this leads to a great deal of typing fun.</p><p><code>#feelsbrightman</code></p><h2 id=running-update>Running update</h2><p>Back in <a href=/2019/09/09/weekly-head-voices-177-streakers/>WHV #177</a> I embraced the space and acquired my first pair of Altras, a
pair of road shoes named Escalante 1.0, for a good price, because the 1.5 had
already been released.</p><p>Recently I was again in the fortunate position to buy a pair of 1.5s for a good
price, as, you guessed it, the 2.0 had already been released.</p><p>The new babies look like this:</p><figure><a href=altra_escalante_1.5.jpg><img sizes="(min-width: 35em) 1200px, 100vw" srcset='https://cpbotha.net/2020/09/16/weekly-head-voices-204-what-is-your-purpose/altra_escalante_1.5_hubf87e8a77a5ca4fb8ed62f60a5e7acbc_1920181_480x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 480w,

running. Now they are just for cocktail parties and business meetings.)</p><p>On a more philosophical note, with the aforementioned improving weather, the
aforementioned increased pressure at work, and the non-aforementioned abundance
of mountains all around me, I have taken to randomly taking a few hours off
from aforementioned work to go run in the now aforementioned mountains.</p><p><code>#feelslifeaffirmingman</code></p><h2 id=what-is-your-purpose>What is your purpose?</h2><p>We have a great tradition here at the WHV of revising our official and utterly
complete life philosophy based on discussions with wise friends.</p><p>See for example <a href=/2017/07/30/weekly-head-voices-124-ceci-nest-pas-dennui/>WHV #124</a> where I had to add a third rule to <em>WHV&rsquo;s Two Rules
for Achieving Great Success in Life, or Just Surviving, Whichever Comes First</em>.</p><p>Quite poetically, the additional rule was &ldquo;Evolve&rdquo;.</p><p>(FYI, the current official WHV approach to life, the universe and everyhing is
summarised in <a href=/2020/06/16/weekly-head-voices-198-short-update-for-future-me/#post-scriptum-the-whv-approach-to-life-the-universe-and-everything>WHV #198</a>.)</p><p>During the beautifully-surrounded lunch discussion with longest-time friend
(LTF, henceforth), as depicted in the panoramic photo at the start of this
post, we also spent some time talking about life directions vs. goals.</p><p>As you know, I am <a href=/2012/01/28/slow-philosophy-weekly-head-voices-64/>not a fan of life goals, instead opting for life directions</a>.</p><p>LTF agreed with some of my reasoning, but made the valid point that goals were
required to measure and maintain velocity along one&rsquo;s chosen directions, or
<a href=/2020/01/12/the-2019-to-2020-transition-post/#plans-and-life-directions-for-2020>systems</a>.</p><p>In principle we agree on this point also, but I believe that the conversation
will have to continue, as we still need to define and then articulate a
closed-form solution to the directions vs goals issue, or rather a guideline
that can be used to determine the correct relative dosage.</p><p>Probably more important was LTF&rsquo;s contribution of the concept of &ldquo;purpose&rdquo;.</p><p>One could argue that life directions form one&rsquo;s purpose, but that would be
missing an opportunity I think.</p><p>As LTF later quipped:</p><blockquote><p>Purpose = the reason you get up in the morning. Goals = help you go to sleep at
night.</p></blockquote><p>At least in my case, I have a number of life directions, but I think a purpose
is a higher-level, mostly singular, desired outcome of your life&rsquo;s work.</p><p>Ideally, <em>life directions</em> should be set in order to orient one towards
fulfilling one&rsquo;s <em>purpose</em>, with continuously evolving <em>goals</em> punctuating the way
there.</p><p>What is <em>your</em> purpose?</p></div><div class=article-toc><h3>Contents</h3><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><ul><li><a href=#sleep-update>Sleep update</a></li><li><a href=#wsl2-and-nativecomp-emacs-workflow-update>WSL2 and nativecomp Emacs workflow update</a></li><li><a href=#keyboard-update-unicorns-with-rgb>Keyboard update: Unicorns-with-RGB</a></li><li><a href=#running-update>Running update</a></li><li><a href=#what-is-your-purpose>What is your purpose?</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div><footer class=article-footer><ul class=article-tag-list><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/altra>altra</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/backyard-philosophy>backyard philosophy</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/emacs>emacs</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/goals>goals</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/keyboards>keyboards</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/purpose>purpose</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/sleep>sleep</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/wsl>wsl</a></li></ul></footer></div><nav id=article-nav><a href=/2020/09/20/weekly-head-voices-205-real-time-sometimes-async-most-of-the-time/ id=article-nav-newer class=article-nav-link-wrap><div class=article-nav-title><span>&lt;</span>&nbsp;
