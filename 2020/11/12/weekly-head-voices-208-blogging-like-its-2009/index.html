Two days ago, as I pressed the &ldquo;publish&rdquo; button on WHV #208 (well, it&rsquo;s actually more me doing the t d C-c C-e H H shortcut key sequence in Emacs, but OK), I knew that #209 was going to be a problem.

that Joris Voorn released, on November 6, a brand new album with tracks and
mixes, this time the collection titled <a href=https://www.globalunderground.co.uk/product/gu43-deluxe-edition/>&ldquo;GU43: Joris Voorn, Rotterdam&rdquo;</a>.</p><p>(Thank you <a href=/about/weekly-head-voices-abbreviations/>TPN</a> for again bringing this musical gift under my attention.)</p><p>This new release is an important event to me, because I have been wondering for
quite a number of years now if we&rsquo;d ever be graced by a spiritual follow-up to
Voorn&rsquo;s Balance 014.</p><p>You see, if my life in 2009 had had a soundtrack, Balance 014 would be it.</p><p>It was an important part of the flavour of that whole sweet year, and to a
certain extent also of that of the year after that.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s jump back there for a spell:</p><h2 id=my-2009-year-mix>My 2009 year mix</h2><p>2009 was the year of my first mini-sabbatical, a <a href=/2009/04/25/my-first-sabbatical/>month-long academic visit to
the University of Magdeburg</a>.</p><p>That period in my memory is enveloped in the warm fuzzies, for the largest part
thanks to the lovely people I had the privilege of sharing a bit of life with
there in the spring.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t think the comparative visualization tool I started working on as main
goal of the sabbatical ever led to anything directly. I do regret that the
abbreviation I came up with, namely &ldquo;CoMedI&rdquo;, for &ldquo;Compare Medical Images&rdquo;, did
not see any further use.</p><p>Anyways, I remember a number of multi-hour train trips between Delft,
Magdeburg, Berlin and elsewhere, almost always with Balance 014 on my
headphones.</p><p>2009 was also the year of:</p><ul><li><a href=/2009/04/04/when-the-going-gets-tough/>me getting on twitter for the first time</a></li><li><a href=/2009/05/21/you-must-vaccinate/>my slightly angry pro-vaccination post</a>, mostly because I was quite surprised
(actually a bit shocked) that even people in <em>my</em> circles were doubting

Although I lost the
heads-up display bet (at one point right before Google Glass didn&rsquo;t really
make it, it looked like I could have won) and I&rsquo;m probably going to lose bet
#2 as well, do take note of <a href=/2009/10/18/futuristic-betting-at-visweek-2009/#bet-3-the-future-of-conferences>&ldquo;Bet #3: In 2029, distributed conferences with
tele-presence will be common.&rdquo;</a> How things have changed in the past few
months&mldr;</li></ul><p>I left by far the most relevant year 2009 event for last:</p><p><a href=/2009/08/29/starting-today-head-voices-every-week/>2009 was also the birth of the Weekly Head Voices</a>, shortly after the Lowlands
festival of that year, which coincidentally was a positively <em>ridiculous</em>
amount of fun.</p><p>So, GU#43 this year leads me, via Balance 014, all the way back to the origin
of the WHV in the year 2009.</p><p>Did you notice the number of this edition of the WHV?</p><p>Entirely coincidentally, it&rsquo;s 209!</p><h3 id=tangent-a-life-without-notes>Tangent: A life without notes</h3><p>It&rsquo;s quite shocking how little I have in my notes (or anywhere for that matter)
about that year.</p><p>After quite some digging, I finally discovered where I kept my notes then: I
was going through my google docs phase (HEY IT WAS REALLY SHINY!), with bunches
of draft blog posts imported from another much-loved but long-dead google
product called google notebook.</p><p>For the past few years now, I have journals of almost every single day, and I
can find any of them pretty quickly.</p><p>It feels strange, perhaps even a little scary, trying to page back into 2009,
and finding only a few google docs, backed-up photos from the Nokia E71 I used
then, a few blog posts, and what I could extract from my own imperfect wetware.</p><h2 id=thank-you-joris>Thank you Joris</h2><p>So, is GU43 the spiritual successor I&rsquo;ve been waiting for?</p><p>No dreamy brain, of course it isn&rsquo;t.</p><p>What would that even mean, for a favourite artist&rsquo;s new work to be a spiritual
successor of a particular previous work?</p><p>Thanks to my memories of 2009 and its music and its <em>feelings</em> pleasantly
echoing over the years in some subset of the trillions of synapses in my head,
I had imagined that this new work, the successor, might be able to bring those
feelings back to life, magically.</p><p>It can&rsquo;t.</p><p>The musical echoes of Balance 014 can certainly be heard in GU43, inevitably
transmitted through the hands of the artist, but this is a new soundtrack
waiting for new adventures.</p><p>Memory neurons fire pleasantly, until they are repurposed for new experiences,
forever forgetting their history.</p><p>I am grateful for the music, both for remembering, and for forgetting.</p></div><div class=article-toc><h3>Contents</h3><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><ul><li><a href=#searching-for-balance-014-in-2020>Searching for Balance 014 in 2020</a></li><li><a href=#my-2009-year-mix>My 2009 year mix</a><ul><li><a href=#tangent-a-life-without-notes>Tangent: A life without notes</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#thank-you-joris>Thank you Joris</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div><footer class=article-footer><ul class=article-tag-list><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/balance-014>balance 014</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/gu43>gu43</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/joris-voorn>joris voorn</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/memory>memory</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/note-taking>note-taking</a></li></ul></footer></div><nav id=article-nav><a href=/2020/11/29/weekly-head-voices-210-miniburn-2020/ id=article-nav-newer class=article-nav-link-wrap><div class=article-nav-title><span>&lt;</span>&nbsp;
