of my time that I decided, with significant difficulty (remember these puzzles
are like cat nip for nerds), to drop out.</p><p>It&rsquo;s been great fun, and I learned so much <a href=https://nim-lang.org/>nim</a> in such a short period, but at
some point one has to make the call whether the time cost is justified by the
fun and the learning.</p><p>P.S. It took about two days to finally let go. :)</p><h2 id=use-it-or-lose-it>Use it, or lose it</h2><p>I am currently reading the fascinating book <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51778153-livewired><em>Livewired: The Inside Story of the
Ever-Changing Brain</em></a> by neuro-scientist <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David%5FEagleman>David Eagleman</a>.</p><p>As you can probably deduce from the title, this book is about how the brain
never stops rewiring itself.</p><p>Even now as you&rsquo;re reading these words, your brain is making and breaking
connections, and changing chemical balances, as it crunches through and
sometimes integrates the ideas that are invoked by this weird trick we humans
do, called <em>speech</em>, and the even weirder trick, called <em>writing</em>.</p><p>(Writing: Your retinae count the photons coming from the screen on which you&rsquo;re
reading this, construct patterns of darkness and light, convert those patterns
to words, and then string together those words into living, breathing
simulations of reality in your giant neural network.)</p><p>Besides functioning as an awe-inspiring exploration of the inner workings of
the brain and the nervous system, also for me with a little bit of existing
background, the book explains the phenomenon that inside the brain there is a
never-ending struggle between brain regions, between neurons and between the
thoughts that they store.</p><p>If you are blindfolded for a few days, your audio cortex will start annexing
parts of your visual cortex. If you&rsquo;re blindfolded for long enough (don&rsquo;t do
this), your visual cortex could be repurposed completely.</p><p>Neurons compete for incoming data, memories compete for neurons; it&rsquo;s a
continual fight for existence.</p><p>When a new, more important or more stressful memory arrives, it can push out,
into eternal oblivion, an older, less interesting memory.</p><p>If an input data stream like sight or hearing stops, another strong input
stream will take over those neurons. When you stop practising long division, or
algebraic simplification, you&rsquo;ll first start to get slower, and then later lose
that ability.</p><p>Those neurons have been repurposed.</p><p>(The book posits a really interesting hypothesis for why humans dream so
visually: Your eyes are closed for a large part of the day. Your visual cortex
would take a beating every night, i.e. be taken over by other parts of your
brain, if you didn&rsquo;t use it so actively during dreaming every night.)</p><p>You can probably see where this is going.</p><p>In the brain, just like in the rest of your human physiology, efficiency is
everything.</p><p>The moment you stop practising a certain function, like math, or absorbing
technical documents, or programming, or driving, or running, or being kind,
your system will start to try to repurpose as much as possible of the required
subsystems for other functions that you <em>are</em> actively deploying.</p><p>In short: <em>Use it, or lose it.</em></p><p>You&rsquo;re going to have to keep on practising all of the things you find important
until the day all of it stops for the last time.</p><p>This may seem quite harsh, but man, does it keep us honest.</p></div><div class=article-toc><h3>Contents</h3><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><ul><li><a href=#my-advent-of-code-comes-to-an-end>My Advent of Code comes to an end</a></li><li><a href=#use-it-or-lose-it>Use it, or lose it</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div><footer class=article-footer><ul class=article-tag-list><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/advent-of-code>advent of code</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/backyard-philosophy>backyard philosophy</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/brain>brain</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/neuroscience>neuroscience</a></li></ul></footer></div><nav id=article-nav><a href=/2020/12/30/weekly-head-voices-213-merry-christmas/ id=article-nav-newer class=article-nav-link-wrap><div class=article-nav-title><span>&lt;</span>&nbsp;
