Weekly Head Voices #197 looks back at the week from Monday June 1 to Sunday June 7.











     
            Figure 1: Weekend morning runs are generally great, but this Saturday morning run was particularly perfect.

although they still have indirect benefits.</p><p>In any case, the two I linked to above both failed, so at least that&rsquo;s nice for
consistency.</p><p>However, on Friday I went and bucked the trend ever so slightly by
soft-launching the Lazar Focus app and website distraction blocker for Windows.</p><p>I <a href=/2020/05/31/weekly-head-voices-196-get-focused/#lazar-focus-the-super-tiny-windows-app-and-website-distraction-blocker-that-you-ve-always-wanted>mentioned LF last week</a>, but it now has a website, called <a href=https://lazarfocused.com/>lazarfocused.com</a>,
and it has a <a href=https://gumroad.com/l/yExQgr>product page on gumroad</a>.</p><p>It has a <em>substantially</em> smaller number of bugs thanks to brilliant beta
testing by multi-modal medical visualization expert and productivity app
<em>connoisseuse</em> <a href=http://noeskasmit.com/>Noeska</a>.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re on Windows, this is exactly the little app you need to block
distractions, only when you say so of course, so that you can focus on all of
The Important Stuff™ you undoubtedly would rather get done, so that you
can get back to goofing off.</p><p>AMIRITE?!</p><p>If you&rsquo;re one of those people who don&rsquo;t need any help to help focusing and to
stay in the zone, but you work with people who might, the <a href=https://lazarfocused.com/2020/06/06/the-philosophy-behind-lazar-focus/>philosophy behind
Lazar Focus</a> blog post is a good introduction to share with them. (Also, could I
interview you? :)</p><h2 id=dry-january-finally-ends--or-maybe-not--with-rochefort>Dry January finally ends (or maybe not) with Rochefort</h2><p>This year, I <a href=/2020/01/12/the-2019-to-2020-transition-post/#plans-and-life-directions-for-2020>started Experiment Alcohol Zero (EAZ) on January 6</a>.</p><p>I&rsquo;m happy to report that this was interrupted only once for a superb glass of
my favourite Chardonnay (that&rsquo;s the Haskell Anvil, see <a href=/2019/10/17/weekly-head-voices-181-the-slow-ones/#what-i-did-in-week-41>WHV #181</a> for the first
encounter) with besties, right at the source.</p><p>Other than that, I remained in EAZ until Saturday, June 6, when the St
Bernhardus Abt 12 and the Trappistes Rochefort #8 and #10 that a friend had
brought for me all the way from The Netherlands and that had been waiting
patiently for me in the cupboard, had just been sitting there waiting for long
enough.</p><p>(By the way, the St Bernhardus Abt 12 is a taste clone of the Westvleteren, the
pretty expensive king of the Trappist beers, as a drunk gentleman once
explained to me in the Doerak in Delft late one evening. He was right, as my
companion and I subsequently confirmed when we acquired both beers for a
comparative tasting on the spot.)</p><p>The time, but far more pertinently the opportunity, had come to end (or was it
merely to interrupt&mldr;) EAZ 2020.</p><p>Friends, that Rochefort is simply packed with a multitude of sweet, warm
memories of days and evenings in my other home, with my other family.</p><figure><a href=rochefort_8_action_shot.jpg><img sizes="(min-width: 35em) 1200px, 100vw" srcset='https://cpbotha.net/2020/06/11/weekly-head-voices-197-shipping-a-side-project/rochefort_8_action_shot_hu_1d90a1400dfe275c.jpg 480w,

written record of my very first encounter with Rochefort</a>, all the way back in
2003, right in the town of La Roche-en-Ardenna, about 30 minutes away from
Rochefort itself. Reading that post now, it really was a sort of WHV avant la
lettre!)</p><h2 id=the-last-bit>The last bit</h2><p>Ok folks, it is now 22:17 on Thursday evening, and I&rsquo;m at that super difficult
&ldquo;HOW IN THOR&rsquo;S NAME DO I CONCLUDE THIS THING?!"-stage, a problem which I seem
to be solving with the &ldquo;I KNOW LET&rsquo;S BREAK THE FOURTH WALL / SIMPLY TALK
ABOUT HOW WE DON&rsquo;T KNOW HOW TO END THIS THING&rdquo;-manoeuvre.</p><p>On the bright side, I think we did <em>just</em> make the deadline with this edition
of the WHV, narrowly avoiding postponement and a larger-than-normal next post.</p><p>Have a brilliant rest of the week and weekend. I look forward to seeing you
again, here and anywhere!</p><p>P.S.
