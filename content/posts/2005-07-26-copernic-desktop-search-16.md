Because I&#8217;m ever-so-slightly WABbing and because I like this software: [Coperinic Desktop Search 1.6][1] has just been released. An important new feature is the &#8220;pause indexing when running on battery power&#8221; option, especially useful for laptop users.

I used [GDS][2] for a while, but Copernic offers finer-grained control over what&#8217;s indexed and what isn&#8217;t. Together with the laptop-friendliness aspect, Copernic makes a convincing pitch.
