I hope to have time this weekend to report on significant and wonderful recent events, but until then, I wanted to share some less important but nonetheless good news with you. My house is more than 3km from the telephone exchange, so my ADSL connection could manage 5.4 Mbit/s down and 0.8 Mbit/s up on a good day, but during the evenings and on weekends, it would go completely wonky and generally unstable. Frustrating, to say the least.

Enter cable internet! I just linked up the shiny new cable modem today, and now finally feel like I’m really part of the information highway. Check it:
