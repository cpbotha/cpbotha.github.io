[Paul][1] links to [this CNN article][2] from his weblog. I thought it was so ridiculous that I would link to it too.

In short: a man dares to wear &#8220;Give Peace a Chance&#8221; T-shirt in an American mall, is told by two security guards to remove the shirt or leave the mall, refuses to do so and is consequently arrested.

Don&#8217;t forgot to read some of the comments on my [previous posting][3]. It turns out our friends from the US _officially_ believe that they should rule the world.
