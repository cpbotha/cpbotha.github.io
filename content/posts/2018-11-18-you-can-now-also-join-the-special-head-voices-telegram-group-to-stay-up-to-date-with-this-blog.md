As an alternative to the email list, I have just setup a [telegram group][1] which you could join if you’d like to be kept up to date with posts from this blog via instant messenger!

If all goes according to plan, a notification should be sent to the group automatically whenever I publish a post over here.

P.S. I first did this with [IFTTT’s Telegram applet][3], but its post preview was pretty bad. [TheFeedReaderBot][4] seems to do a much better job!
