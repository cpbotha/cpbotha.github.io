On Friday, [Eric][1] and I went to Rotterdam for some easter-Friday shopping. Somehow, I ended up purchasing this beautiful machine:

It eats coffee beans and produces the most beautiful espressos, all at the press of a button. The cappuccinos are also nothing to sneeze it&#8230; in fact, that little silver ball thingy on the right mixes steam and milk (that it sucks up through its flexible tube) to create perfect foam with user-adjustable consistency.

My coffee glands have never been so happy in their slimy little lives.
