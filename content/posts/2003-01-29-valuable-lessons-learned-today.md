After having gone back to my workstation vendor for the 4th time in so many months today with a broken graphics card and after having had to replace the now scarce SMP motherboard, I&#8217;ve learned two very valuable lessons:

  1. When you buy a workstation for Real Work(tm), get **at least** a three year on-site guarantee. You might think that you can&#8217;t afford the extra EUR150 (or roundabout), but after you tally up all the time you might have to spend fixing your own workstation during its lifetime, you&#8217;ll realise that you&#8217;re wrong.
  2. When given the credit card at the beginning of a four year project to buy the machine of your dreams, DON&#8217;T splurge. Buy a somewhat more modest machine, but make the arrangement that you&#8217;ll have the right to purchase a brand new computer half way through the project. Remember how fast computing equipment ages.
