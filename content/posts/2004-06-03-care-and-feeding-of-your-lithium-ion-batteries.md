Yes, I am exceedingly happy with my laptop. More about this later.

In the meanwhile, read [this][1] for the low-down on the care and feeding of your Lithium-Ion batteries (in most modern laptops). In short: partial charging is better than fully discharging and recharging, although a full discharge-recharge cycle every once in a while is good for calibrating the digital fuel gauge. Lithium-Ion batteries hate high temperature, especially the temperature in your laptop. If you&#8217;re going to be running on wall power for a while, remove the battery. Ideally, store it in a cool place at between 30% and 50% charge.
