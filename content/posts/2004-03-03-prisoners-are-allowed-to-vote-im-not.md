South Africa is a great country, but sometimes things can be completely crazy. It turns out that [even prisoners can vote][1] in the upcoming general election (it&#8217;s their constitutional right, apparently), but that **I can&#8217;t**, as I am working in a foreign country. Why are my constitutional rights considered less important? Is it because I don&#8217;t steal and pillage in my own country but earn a salary elsewhere?

I&#8217;m just wondering.
