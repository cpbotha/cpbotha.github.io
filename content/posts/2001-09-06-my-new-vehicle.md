Our bicycles were stolen&#8230; really shitty. See my rants pages. In anycase, we&#8217;ve bought new ones (a big chunk paid for by the insurance). Now in spite of the shittiness of the previous ones having been stolen, I have to say that my new transportation is rather spiffy. So spiffy in fact, that I have decided to refrain from calling it a bicycle instead opting for the far more apt &#8220;Inter-Galactic Battle-Cruiser&#8221;. So children, if you see a terribly advanced space-cruiser flying past you on the way to work, it&#8217;s probably just me on my new Cumberland GL. Damn, I love my IGBC.
