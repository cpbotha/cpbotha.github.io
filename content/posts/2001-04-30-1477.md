Note to world: w3m still rules. I can use it to update via blogger.com (not even opera can do that) and when I edit my blog, w3m automatically opens my favourite text editor (jed, doh) to do this with.

After quite a bit of work, I&#8217;ve fixed a bug in linux kernel 2.4.4 on the VT82C686A south bridge. The patch is submitted to the mailing list, so now hold thumbs that it appears in 2.4.5 (or something).
