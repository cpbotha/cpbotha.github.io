Yummy Sunday. One whole day of sitting around and playing with stuff. It seems my brain was working behind my back, because the one really convoluted paper I had to review suddenly became very understandable, in spite of the authors’ insistence on making everything as difficult as mathematically possible.

My pet project is slowly taking shape. Fortunately, with all that open source around, it’s going much faster than it would’ve otherwise. Obviously, if I even half-finish it, it’ll be open source too. Maybe one or two crazy people will find it useful.

Meeup, tomorrow I get to go to Utrecht again, this time to have all the secrets of MRI revealed by probably Mr MRI himself.
