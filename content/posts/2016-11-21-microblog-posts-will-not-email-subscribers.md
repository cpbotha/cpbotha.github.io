One of my threeÂ subscribers was understandably less than happy about receiving email for every microblog-style post here.

Using [the Code Snippets plugin][1] and [the jetpack subscriptions exclude categories filter][2], I have now configured the blog so that in theory it should not mail subscribers when I post in the microblog category.

In short: Email subscribers won&#8217;t receive any microblog post emails. I hope this helps!
