Four days ahead of time, the ADSL has been activated at my new house. I&#8217;ve been migrated to a different network operator (I used to be on the Tiscali network, now on BBNed) and the line has been &#8220;opened&#8221;. Distance to the exchange seems to have quite an effect, I&#8217;m connected at 5472 kbps downstream and 928 kbps upstream. According to [http://pcdb.bbned.nl/][1], I&#8217;m 1.6km from the exchange. A rough calculation on my downstream attenuation of 46db, yields an estimated distance of 3.3km. I&#8217;ll sort this out later to make sure that it&#8217;s just the distance working me over, and not some misconfiguration somewhere.

Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I&#8217;m really very appreciative of my prodigal link. Thanks to the generosity of the TU Delft, my gracious employer, it&#8217;s costing me the grand total of 5 euro-pesos per month, so I&#8217;m _really_ not going to complain.

I have to go now, there are ZILLIONS of new torrents that need my love and attention.
