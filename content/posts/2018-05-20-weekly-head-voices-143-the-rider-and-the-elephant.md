Welcome back kids!

Besides this post, which somehow turned out to be longer than I expected, my more nerdy alter ego also wrote a post titled [Interactive programming with Fennel Lua Lisp, Emacs and Lisp Game Jam winner EXO_encounter 667][1].

# #DeleteFacebook, part deux

In an unsurprising (to me) turn of events, the Cambridge Analytica scandal has not even caused a dent in Facebook usage.

#deletefacebook, also discussed in a [previous edition of the WHV][2], never really happened.

To the contrary, it seems people even [increased their usage, post-scandal][3]. FB share price is back where it used to be, and as an interesting data point, Deutsche Bank reports that their FB-based advertising reach was unaffected by the removable of more than 500 million fake facebook accounts.

Should we deduce anything more from this than the usual 1. humans, even outraged ones, have really short memories and/or 2. most people don&#8217;t have the energy to resist, or the presence of mind to avoid, the deeply-seated social desires that are being exploited to varying degrees by the large social networks?

My personal strategy for a while now has been to make _liberal_ use of the unfollow and the mute functions. It&#8217;s far from perfect, but with this it is possible to reduce drastically the stream of incoming information, and to make sure that what does come through has to do with friends that you have made the deliberate choice to connect with actively.

# Shorter focus blocks work better

In my eternal and sometimes decidedly [Sysiphean][4]Â quest for more and better work focus, I recently started using Focus App (see Pro Tip #2 in [WHV #126][5]).

In short, when you activate the app&#8217;s focus mode, it kills off and then blocks anything that is remotely fun or even slightly distracting on your computer. This includes websites and applications.

In the beginning, I was enjoying longer (1 to 2 hour) focus blocks.

However, more recently I started noticing a certain recalcitrance in my focus-starting hand.

Especially late in the afternoons (prefrontal cortex GONE by then, remember?) the knowledge of that mega-block of mental exertion would result in highly undesirable procrastinatory behaviour. (Big words for &#8220;oh, I can probably fit in one more /r/emacs post!&#8221;)

Anyways, it turns out there&#8217;s another really good reason that pomodori are only 25 minutes long.

It&#8217;s much easier to start a 25 minute block of no-fun-focus, and then get stuck in the zone, than it is to start what your brain expects to be a multi-hour block of mental exertion.

Friend PK introduced me to the tiny rider trying to control the giant elephant as a metaphor for the conscious and unconscious mind (this is from the book [The Happiness Hypothesis][6]). The shorter focus block idea seems like it could be filed away under &#8220;tricks to control your stubborn elephant&#8221;.

# The evolving soul of Emacs

I came across this [really interesting piece by Richard Stallman][7] about the origin of Emacs, one of my favourite and probably most-used technical artifacts. It&#8217;s the multi-tool of computer software.

> But, along the way, I wrote a text editor, Emacs. The interesting idea about Emacs was that it had a programming language, and the user&#8217;s editing commands would be written in that interpreted programming language, so that you could load new commands into your editor while you were editing. You could edit the programs you were using and then go on editing with them. So, we had a system that was useful for things other than programming, and yet you could program it while you were using it. I don&#8217;t know if it was the first one of those, but it certainly was the first editor like that.

When an experienced user interacts with Emacs, they change it, and it changes them.

# The opposite of instant gratification

On Friday I started on a slightly longer than usual run.

It usually takes a kilometre or two before all of my running subsystems come on line, and I find my rhythm.

Not this time.

The acclimatisation discomfort in my ankles and calves didn&#8217;t fade away as it usually does. My breathing and running cadence stubbornly refused to lock on to their usual correct settings.

My legs felt tired.

It really felt like I was not supposed to be running at all, but I pressed on because at that point there was not much else I could do.

At the turn-around point (the bridge at the entrance to Vergelegen, with beautiful trees all around) I decided to try out some youtube advice from the evening before and do a few deep squats to freshen up my legs.

I started running back on legs and calves and feet which suddenly felt like they had all been replaced with brand-new rested versions of their 2-minute-ago return-to-manufacturer selves.

The rest of the run was of the _floating_ over the ground how-is-this-possible my-smile-might-break-my-head variety.

Super strange.

I don&#8217;t think the squats did it. That was just a sort of thought-process punctuation which somehow distracted the mind-elephant for long enough to get me running again.

Anyways, as I was floating home, I could not help but see the whole occurrence as a fairly physical but in this case fortunately quite compact reminder that some of the most worthwhile experiences simply require perseverance with initially no gratification in sight.

# Life is a marathon

&#8230; so sleep well, eat as healthily as you can, exercise, and try not to stress too much.

We&#8217;re in this for the long haul.
