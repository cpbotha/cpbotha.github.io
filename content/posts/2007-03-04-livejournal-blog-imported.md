Because I could, I went and exported all posts and comments from my old Livejournal blog (it was still alive!) with [ljarchive][1] and imported everything into this here shiny new weblog. If you&#8217;re into that type of thing, you can now go back as far as [May 2001][2], or read [this post about the BRAND SPANKING NEW Mozilla 0.9.9 release][3] (by a very naive idealist open source standards zealot), or even [this gem lamenting the supernatural amounts of rain in NL][4]!

On the topic of retrospection, don&#8217;t forget to check out [the post][5] that finally revealed my fascination with rubber-hosed justice!
