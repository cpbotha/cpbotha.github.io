With every edition I claim that I have no time to post, but this time, I have even less time than usual. However, here I am to bring you a super-duper compact time-saving edition of the Weekly Head Voices, filled with the highlights of week 12 of 2011. I’ll start this edition with some church:
{{< figure src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/nieuwe_kerk_van_achter.jpg" link="/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/nieuwe_kerk_van_achter.jpg" caption="Pretty spring photo of the back of the New Church in Delft, taken whilst I was waiting for my guest (Our Man in Vienna, temporarily in Delft!) to exit his hotel.">}} 

  * I’ve tried to give you a more snappy blog loading experience by installing the [WP Super Cache][1] (with a 24 hour site preload), [DB Cache Reloaded Fix][2] and [Use Google Libraries][3] plugins. In many cases, you’ll get served a static HTML page, which is much faster than the on-demand SQL-spewing PHP-generated complexity WordPress usually does. In the great big quagmire that is WordPress caching plugins, this combination seems to be working best in my case. Measuring with [tools.pingdom.org][4] (awesome resource!), most of the pages on this site should now fully render in around 2 seconds.
  * The [TNR][5] and I souped up the [work website][6], it’s looking really spiffy now, with embedded RSS feeds and all!
  * I’ve finally installed [JuiceDefender][7] on my [laptop with built-in telephone][8] (my HTC Desire Z smartphone, in other words), the battery almost lasts the whole day now! If you have an Android telephone and your not happy with your battery life (err, is that even a question?), get this app. Now.
  * I opposed an M.Sc. defence on Tuesday on the ultrasound measurement of tendon displacement _in vivo_ and subsequent derivation of moment arms. Great fun diving into new work like that! The student did a great job.
  * [Our Man in Vienna][9] came to visit us in Delft. Huge fun was had by me and Our Man in Vienna (I hope), and serious work was done. It’s a great combination, we will attempt to apply it more often.
  * On Friday evening I slipped and did our [yearly tax return][10] by accident. BAM!

This is the end my friend. Here’s some more church (a different one, at least), taken after a scrumptious dinner in the city:

Have a great week everyone! Over here, we’ll be chasing deadlines, and many of ’em. WATCH OUT YOU DEADLINES!
