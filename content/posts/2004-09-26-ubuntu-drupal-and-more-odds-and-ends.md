The Seagate 120G drive in my firewall machine died at the very young age of 8 months. I sent it in to Seagate via the RMA procedure and got a new one back within about 3 days, which I did find quite impressive. In the mean time, I started using a cheap-assed hardware firewall/router/modem thingy, which means I have a machine to play with.

[Ubuntu][1] went on there without a hitch and I must say I&#8217;m VERY impressed. It&#8217;s Debian-based, but without all the crap that so sours the otherwise healthy Debian experience. It also has a \*much\* shorter release cycle. Mark Shuttleworth, a South African who&#8217;s rich beyond belief but uses his money for really groovy things like being a space tourist and sponsoring deserving open source projects and whatnot, seems to be inspiration behind the whole project. I&#8217;m definitely convinced.

I&#8217;m slowly migrating [my website][2] over to Drupal. After having installed the navigation module and solving a REALLY mysterious problem with FollowSymlinks breaking everything, it&#8217;s starting to look better and better.
