Due to my terrible running addiction, my recent acquisition of the Samsung Gear Fit 2 sports tracker watch, and the mechanical [incompatibility of the Bluedio Ci3 earphones with my ears][1], I was again in the market for a new set of bluetooth earphones. (The earphones are not only to listen to MP3s on the watch, but more importantly, to hear the pacing information communicated by the watch&#8217;s terrible synthesised voice.)

After some scratching around on [Takealot.com][2], our otherwise wonderful local Amazon-analogue, I settled on the Awei A990-BL Wireless Sport Bluetooth Earphones.

After just under a month of real-world testing of these earphones (that is, running with them a few times a week, they are &#8220;sport&#8221; earphones after all), punctuated by disappointing performance and some mechanical breakage, and culminating in complete hardware failure, I can make only this very simple recommendation:

> DO NOT under any circumstances buy the Awei A990-BL Wireless Sport Bluetooth Earphones. They have attained the rarely awarded &#8220;cpbotha.net THREE (3) thumbs down, avoid at all costs&#8221; review.

# A complete set of accessories

I was pretty happy when the the earphones arrived on November 15, right on time, and with a pretty complete set of accessories:

None of the three sets of silicone earbuds were large enough for my ears, an issue that was easily solved by using a set of my old Sennheiser buds. My last Skullkandy earphones had the same issue, so I&#8217;m ascribing it to my anatomy and not to Awei.

# Ear clips break easily

During the first run with these earphones in the wind (when one also really notices how the control unit, a few centimetres from one&#8217;s right ear, can really flop around), I realised that the curved ear hooks were definitely necessary. For the next few runs, I had them clipped onto the earphones and they made a huge difference keeping music in my ears.

However, at the start of another run, I slight re-adjustment of the hooks relative to the earphones caused both of the earbud attachment bits to break clean off, rendering these accessories completely useless. I used a reasonable amount of force, and have to conclude that these clips are just not well made:

# Bluetooth transmission hiccups

Besides the breakage, I also noticed from the start regular little breaks in the music transmission from the Gear Fit 2 to my ears. It&#8217;s possible that these were somehow caused by the unit&#8217;s movement during my exercise. I take this opportunity to remind the reader of the &#8220;sport&#8221; classification of this Awei product.

It could also be that the Gear Fit 2&#8217;s bluetooth implementation is sub-par, but, unlike the Awei, it&#8217;s an a-list product. In the following weeks I will be able to test this hypothesis with alternative hardware.

# Complete hardware failure

About 25 calendar days after purchase, the unit spontaneously died during a run, a disappointment in itself. At first I thought that it was simply the battery that was exhausted. However, no amount of charging back home could revive the earphones.

My Awei A990-BL earphones remain completely dead to this day.

# Quo vadis emptor?

After two failed attempts, first with the Bluedio Ci3 and then with these Awei headphones, I have decided to go a different route with the [Samsung Level Link bluetooth adapter][3].

I&#8217;ll be able to use any wired earphones (at a much better price-performance ratio, and also much easier to replace) and just plug them into the Samsung Level Link, which will connect wirelessly to the Gear Fit 2.
