Usually, it costs us 62.24 euro cents per minute to call home to ZA. With the “voordeelnummers” discount of KPN, it costs 43.57 euro cents per minute. Obviously we’ve activated this for the numbers we call often.

This weekend I decided to have a look see at the alternative long distance carriers again. We’d had a bad experience with Tele 2, but that was some time ago. After a bit of googling, I came across [bel1601][1]: we now call ZA at 7 (yes SEVEN) euro cents per minute and 5 cents startup per call. Tonight I had the privilege of paying EUR 1.90 for 27 minutes of chatting.

Coincidentally, phoning locally through bel1601 is also \*significantly\* cheaper than KPN… This is almost too good to be true, but we’ll definitely enjoy the ride while it lasts.
