In 2013, the secure email service Lavabit voluntarily shutdown when they were pressured by the US government to leak user data. They were prohibited by law to speak up about the details of the events surrounding this incident. I&#8217;m not sure how long the chilling farewell message will remain on the [Lavabit website][1], or how long the website will remain available, so I&#8217;m posting it here as well, first in text form, then a screenshot of the site on 2013-09-15:

>     I have been forced to make a difficult decision: to become complicit in crimes against the American people or walk away from nearly ten years of hard work by shutting down Lavabit. After significant soul searching, I have decided to suspend operations. I wish that I could legally share with you the events that led to my decision. I cannot. I feel you deserve to know what’s going on&#8211;the first amendment is supposed to guarantee me the freedom to speak out in situations like this. Unfortunately, Congress has passed laws that say otherwise. As things currently stand, I cannot share my experiences over the last six weeks, even though I have twice made the appropriate requests.
