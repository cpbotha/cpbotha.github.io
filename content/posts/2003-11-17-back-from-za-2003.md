What a lovely holiday… I got time to party with many of the friends, spend quality time with the family, drink many Windhoek Lagers and eat too much red meat. Unfortunately, I missed [Goof’s bachelors’ party][1]. Next time! ;)

On a totally unrelated note, it seems my Tungsten E is working with Evolution 1.2.4, gnome-pilot DEBs from <http: debian="" www.madhack.com=""> and some spit. The whole volatile combination seems to be dancing drunkily on the edge of a very sharp Minora blade though…
