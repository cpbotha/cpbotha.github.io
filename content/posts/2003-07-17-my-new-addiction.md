Yesterday, a group of us went to a gaming and gaming history [exhibition][1] in Tilburg. It was marvellous to see (and play) all the games I wasted my time (and 20 ZA-cent coins) on as an arcade-frequenting dude. They even had an old Sinclair Spectrum 48K on exhibit&#8230; this is the computer I grew up on.

In anycase, amongst one of the 120 games that you could also play, [Paul][2] introduced me to [Bust-A-Move 4][3] on the Sega Dreamcast.

All would have been fine, were it not for the fact that this game is also available in [MAME][4] where it&#8217;s known as [Puzzle Bobble 4][5]. If you can help it, _please_ avoid this game. **It&#8217;s scarily addictive. Really.**
