    Carrying the portentous number 42, this edition of the Weekly Head Voices owes it to the sometimes nerdy expectations of its readers to offer at least a small part of the answer to life, the universe and everything. In other words, #42 is 100% backyard philosophy.

    I’ve had a really brilliant week. When it started, one of the slightly more zen voices in my head proposed a little experiment: What would happen if, at the start of <em>every</em> episode or moment that I found myself in, I would consciously and explicitly remind myself to be fully and exclusively in that moment, to focus on the now. I could only agree that this was an intriguing question, and one worth attempting to answer.
  </p>
<p>
    The hardest part was remembering to do this every time. However, once I managed to get past that hurdle, the seemingly simple and low-level act of sub-vocally reminding myself to dedicate my undivided attention to the moment currently at hand resulted in more and more sustained periods of focus, which gave each situation, even the seemingly straightforward ones and especially those involving social contact, significantly more depth. It was almost like flipping a big bass boost button on my daily experiences, with all primary and secondary senses arriving in glorious multi-dimensional technicolour.

<p>
    If your brain is like mine, constantly shooting off in five different tangents at the smallest instigation, I can only recommend this self-reminder trick. There are other times when such tangents are useful and should be stimulated, for example during planning or creative sessions, but more often being fully in the now is what you should go for. This goes diametrically against the grain of our evolved <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_foraging" title="wikipedia on information foraging">information foraging</a> compulsion and the associated multi-tasking (that we turn out to be really bad at), but is worth the mental effort many times over.

    I’ll end this short post with a musical conclusion:

<em>Drown in the now…</em> A beautiful and apt title for a song with some of the most spacy lyrics you’ll come across, at least until the next time you do some Crystal Method.

    Kids, have an awesome week, filled with pure Now.

    p.s. Jorik, in an uncontrollable attack of the WABs, just pointed out a spelling mistake in this post. It’s <em>portentous,</em> and <strong>not</strong> <em>portentious.</em> :)
