Whooohoooo! We’re[1] here at the [IEEE Visualization 2005 conference][1] in the Minneapolis Hilton.

It being Sunday, we’re nursing our 7-hour jet lag and relaxing with a light tutorial, [General Purpose Computing on GPUs][2]. The team presenting this tutorial are some of the heavy-weights in the field and so far it’s quite interesting.

During the next few days, I’ll _try_ and post an update or two. Rubbing shoulders with the Visualisation world’s _Who’s Who_ obviously takes precedence over abusing the conference WLAN to blog like a nerd.

[1] “We” refers to [Frits][3], [Jorik][4] and [me][5].
