Iâ€™ve finally released post XFree86 4.2.99 merge DRI suspend/resume capable Radeon driver snapshots and the adapted patch. Get them fresh [here][1].

Our somewhat new real-time volume renderer, lovingly called the ShellSplatter, is more or less done. Look at the pretty pictures that it makes:

<a data-rel="lightbox-image-1" data-rl_caption="" data-rl_title="" href="http://cpbotha.net/thingies/engineblockhq.png" title="">Rendering of a CT-scan of an engine block, whoooo!</a>

That will be all. Thank you Jeeves.
