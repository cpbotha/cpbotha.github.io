[Here][1] is a site explaining a whole list of common fallacies in arguments. I&#8217;m now less impressed with the site than when I first stumbled onto it, but it&#8217;s still useful. Really.

You can now use phrases like &#8220;_ad hominem_ attacks&#8221; in your flames even if you don&#8217;t know any Latin. Come to think of it, even if your knowledge of Latin is non-existent (you barbarian), you should be able to deduce what that means, unless you&#8217;re really stupid, in which case it took you half an hour to read this sentence anyway and you&#8217;ve now forgotten what it&#8217;s all about, which is exactly the reason why I prefer writing long sentences.
