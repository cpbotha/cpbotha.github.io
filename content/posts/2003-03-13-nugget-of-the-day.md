[Here][1] is a site explaining a whole list of common fallacies in arguments. I’m now less impressed with the site than when I first stumbled onto it, but it’s still useful. Really.

You can now use phrases like “_ad hominem_ attacks” in your flames even if you don’t know any Latin. Come to think of it, even if your knowledge of Latin is non-existent (you barbarian), you should be able to deduce what that means, unless you’re really stupid, in which case it took you half an hour to read this sentence anyway and you’ve now forgotten what it’s all about, which is exactly the reason why I prefer writing long sentences.
