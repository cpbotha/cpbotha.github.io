## Why I don't like dark mode anymore {#why-i-don-t-like-dark-mode-anymore}

As you might know, I spent most of my working (and sometimes hobby, we'll get
back to that further down) hours in front of this screen or some other screen.

Up to now, I was really convinced that I preferred dark mode everywhere, until
recently two events transpired:

I started noticing more eye-strain than usual, even on my 27" screen, something
which had a perceptible effect on my productivity. This I resignedly ascribed
to my advancing age, although I did find the suddenness quite surprising,
especially since I recently had my glasses updated.

Then, after years with only the admittedly brilliant [zenburn](https://github.com/bbatsov/zenburn-emacs) and [Leuven (dark)](https://github.com/fniessen/emacs-leuven-theme)
Emacs themes checking all of the boxes for me, I finally ran into a really
interesting and usable theme called [Poet](https://github.com/kunalb/poet).

It's interesting, because it uses variable pitched fonts for everything but
code, tables and elements of the fixed width domain, where most Emacs fonts
stick to the traditional all-fixed-width approach.

It looks like this:

{{< figure src="20210822-poet-theme-screenshot.png" link="20210822-poet-theme-screenshot.png" >}}

You can probably understand that for someone who uses Emacs almost primarily
for technical notes and other writing, this book-like appearance could work
really well.

The theme was even more interesting for me personally, as it suddenly became
clear as day that I experienced almost no eye-strain when using Emacs with this
lighter theme than when I used any of my other usually dark-themed tools!

It became obvious that poet-theme's lighter background was much easier on my
eyes than dark mode in vscode. (No, this specific advantage can't be ascribed
to Emacs itself I'm afraid.)

Reading pages such as [this](https://www.allaboutvision.com/digital-eye-strain/is-dark-mode-better-for-eyes/) explains that dark mode leads to pupils having to
dilate more to let in more light, which there is less of with dark themes.

This leads to, just like with cameras and any other optics with lenses and
apertures, a shortened depth of field, and hence more difficulty focusing on
the screen!

[This article by the well-known Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/dark-mode/) nicely summarises research
on this topic. In short:

> In people with normal vision (or corrected-to-normal vision), visual
> performance tends to be better with light mode, whereas some people with
> cataract and related disorders may perform better with dark mode.

Up until recently, I did not experience a qualitative difference in vision
between dark and light, but I sit here relieved that my eye-strain issue has
been resolved by an Emacs theme!


## Know how to put down your work {#know-how-to-put-down-your-work}

The following take from [a recent tweet by mike joubert](https://twitter.com/brandsrock/status/1426163442256330753) struck me
(tweet-take-strike! words are funny...):

> The truly valuable skill isn't the capacity to push yourself harder, but to
> stop and recuperate despite the discomfort of knowing that work remains
> unfinished, emails unanswered, other people's demands unfulfilled.

The [article, titled _The three-or-four-hours rule for getting creative work
done_](https://www.oliverburkeman.com/fourhours), is itself a good read about the observation that creative types (amongst
which I count engineers) have at their best three to four hours of focus time
per day --- so it is crucially important that their days are structured such
that there is an **uninterrupted** block of three to four hours inside of which
that lovely focus has the possibility of appearing.

The tweet-extract focuses on the similarly important but more subtle art of
being able to put one's work down, completely, when that block of time is over,
even when it feels like the work is far from complete.

I especially like that it also explicitly mentions the illusions created by
one's perception of "other people's demands", something that ironically becomes
even harder to walk away from when one is more tired at the end of the work
day.

For me, becoming better at putting work down has pleasant echoes of running
slower to run faster, of emptiness in art and more broadly, [choosing fewer f\*cks
to give](https://zenhabits.net/work-less/).


## Follow your blisters {#follow-your-blisters}

On the topic of choosing your ducks...

I initially did not like [this HBR](https://hbr.org/2020/11/what-you-should-follow-instead-of-your-passion) post when it first crossed my stream, because
it smacks a bit too much of the current social media style of "wisdom", namely
"everything you need to know in 280 characters", or "this 1 minute tiktok video
will change your life".

As if that was not enough, the title is pretty clickbaity: _What You Should
Follow Instead of Your Passion_.

However, the core message of the post, which I could not help reading, did
stick with me, and after a few days I realised that I would have to go find the
article again in order to talk about it here.

The core message is to replace _find your passion_ with **_Find your blisters._**

The author's point is that folks often get the wrong idea with _passion_ as
something that is simply always delightful, whilst the thing you should
actually be looking for, is that activity that you simply are unable to stop
doing, even when you try, and especially even when you don't directly derive
pleasure from it, for example because you feel that you're not that good at it.

They give the personal example of writing.

Although they've been at it for years, it's still a difficult and laborious
process, and they are often not happy with the results.

However, they have been unable to stop from returning to writing projects again
and again over the years.

Ironically, even although they find that they are still bad at it, they have in
fact become really good, simply because they have been pushing through and
practising more than almost anyone else over the years.

I really like this down-to-earth view.

One can indeed source almost unlimited amounts of energy from one's "blisters",
but true benefits will for a large part be brought about by a [lifetime of often
challenging practice](/tags/practice/).
