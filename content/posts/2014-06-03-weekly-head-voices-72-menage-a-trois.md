Welcome to this post, the 72nd edition of The Weekly Head Voices, and a momentous one at that. For the first time, I’m writing the WHV using my favourite operating system with editing function, [Emacs][1]. To those of you who don’t know Emacs, this might mean that I’ve finally gone around the bend. 

I can report that it is a very happy place.

</div>

(there will be more Emacs shenanigans in the near future.) 

During this past week, I wrote at least three blog posts (as far as I know): 

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>
<a href="http://vxlabs.com/2014/05/25/emacs-24-with-prelude-org2blog-and-wordpress/">Publish to WordPress with Emacs 24 and org2blog</a> – A super-nerdy post on vxlabs explaining how you too can use Emacs, the operating system with editing function, to write and publish your WordPress blog posts.
  </li>
<li>
<a href="http://cpbotha.net/2014/05/31/south-africa-why-are-you-not-running-linux/">South Africa, why are you not running Linux?</a> – wherein I explain that it would be much better for the South African national economy and technology ecosystem to kick its proprietary software (Microsoft, Apple, etc.) dependency and standardise on open source.
  </li>
<li>
<a href="http://cpbotha.net/2014/05/29/ernestine-teaches-charl-isixhosa-lesson-1/">Ernestine teaches Charl isiXhosa Lesson 1</a> – The first in a new series of posts that I’m super excited about, during which I take you along on my (slow) journey learning <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xhosa_language">isiXhosa</a>, one of our national languages, With Clicks(tm).
  </li>
</ul>

I also had time to enjoy a large number of these home-made (grandparents’ home that is) goodies:

as well as some of this:

{{< figure src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/wpid-droëwors_en_biltong1-300x259.jpg" link="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/wpid-droëwors_en_biltong1.jpg" caption= "Dried sausage (droëwors) and meat (biltong), home-made!" >}}

… and then I finally got around to upgrading my main development laptop from Ubuntu version 12.04 to verson 14.04, code-named _Trusty Tahr_. 

IT’S FULL OF STARS.
