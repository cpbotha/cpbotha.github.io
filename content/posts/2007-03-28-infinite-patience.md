Kids.

You&#8217;re at work having a productive day, and you&#8217;re just about to start with a meeting that you _really_ need to take part in. At that point you get a phone call that your cute-as-a-button daughter has regurgitated three days worth of lunch at the day-care and that you have to come pick her up pronto. What do you do?

You flip that huge red Infinite-Patience(tm) switch, smile, and go pick her up. After changing the N-th diarrhoea nappy (diarrhea diaper to the more American-inclined readers) that has been filled to bursting with nose-destroying evilness but has fortunately only started leaking, and having to catch yet more regurgitated dinner in your hands, you&#8217;re still smiling. When this happens again in a few weeks time, you just reach for that big red switch again.

I&#8217;m still working on the moral of this story. It has something to do with smiling, and also with patience.
