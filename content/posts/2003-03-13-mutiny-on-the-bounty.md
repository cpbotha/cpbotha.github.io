Read [this letter of resignation][1] by John Brady Kiesling to Colin Powell. Truthout summarises it best: &#8220;The letter below, delivered to Secretary of State Colin Powell, is quite possibly the most eloquent statement of dissent thus far put forth regarding the issue of Iraq&#8221;.

Oh yes, I just _BEAT_ [Ben][2] to it, lazy weblogger that he is.
