Intrigued by the trailers of the movie [The Arrival][1], which I have not seen yet, I read the short story compilation _Stories of your life and others_ by Ted Chiang.

The short story _Story of your life_, on which the movie is based, has a fascinating premise. However, I do hear that the film does not spend that much time on her discovery of and assimilation by the alien writing system &#8220;Heptapod B&#8221;, which to me was one of the more interesting threads.

Anyways, this post is not about that story.

It&#8217;s about another story in the collection called [Liking What You See: A Documentary][2], written way back in 2002.

Close to the end, an initially strong campaign for _calliagnosia_ (a non-invasive and highly selective procedure to remove humans&#8217; innate appreciation of attractiveness in others, already a great science-fiction philosophy prop) at the fictitious but influential unversity Pembleton is lost at the last minute due to a highly persuasive televised speech by the leader of the opposition.

Read the following extract for how exactly this was done:

> In the latest on the Pembleton calliagnosia initiative, EduNews has learned that a new form of digital manipulation was used on the broadcast  of PEN spokesperson Rebbecca Boyer&#8217;s speech. EduNews has received files from the SemioTech Warriors that contain what appear to be two recorded versions of the speech: an original &#8212; acquired from the Wyatt/Hayes (ed: PR firm) computers &#8212; and the broadcast version. The files also include the SemioTech Warriors&#8217; analysis of the difference between the two versions.
> 
> The discrepancies are primarily enhancements to Ms. Boyer&#8217;s voice intonation, facial expressions and body language. Viewers who watch the original version rate Ms. Boyer&#8217;s performance as good, while those who watch the edited version rate her performance as excellent, describing her as extraordinarily dynamic and persuasive. The SemioTech Warriors conclude that Wyatt/Hayes has developed new software capabable of fine-tuning paralinguistic cues in order to maximize the emotional response evoked in viewers. This dramatically increases the effectiveness of recorded presentations &#8230; and its use in the PEN broadcast is likely what caused many supporters of the calliagnosia initiative to change their votes.

I would like to remind you that Ted Chiang wrote that story in 2002.

When I read this, I had to sit still for a moment, thinking about all of the advanced techniques that are currently being used to analyse us all, and then to [manipulate or even manufacture news with the explicit purpose of swaying public opinion in a specific direction][3].

My thoughts moved on to the great advances being made with deep learning based human speech synthesis, [facial re-enactment][4] (see youtube at the top of this post), [cut-and-paste voice editing][5] (Adobe&#8217;s VoCo) and much much more.

Up to now, the major mechanisms of influence have been curating _which_ packets of information people consume. However, the tools for also modifying the _contents_ of these packets of information seem to be ready.

We&#8217;ve been photoshopping photos of people to make those people appear more attractive since forever.

How long before we start seriously &#8220;videoshopping&#8221; televised speeches to make them more persuasive? With people consuming ever-increasing amounts of potentially personalised video, there&#8217;s an even bigger opportunity for those who desire to influence us for reasons less pure than just edification.
