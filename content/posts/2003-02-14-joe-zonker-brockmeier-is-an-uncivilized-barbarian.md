A while ago, I read [this fluff piece][1] about [Python][2]. As with most fluff pieces, it was _quite_ inane, but our anthropologist wunderkind Joe “Zonker” Brockmeier succeeded in citing Guido van Rossum incorrectly as “Rossum” instead of “Van Rossum” no less than six different times.

I went through the very tedious process of registering for a login at the offending site in order to post my thoughts in the talkback forum on this embarrassing faux pas. My post **never** appeared in the talkback forum, **but:** all except one of the incorrect citations were silently fixed.

Two things irk me: Joe “International-Cultures-and-Customs-Specialist” Brockmeier could at the very least have made mention of the corrections in the talkback forum and/or posted my entry. To add insult to injury, he **still** has one incorrect citation.

Lord, thank you very much for not incarnating me as Joe “I am an idiot, but will do my damnedest to conceal the fact, yet still fail miserably” Brockmeier.
