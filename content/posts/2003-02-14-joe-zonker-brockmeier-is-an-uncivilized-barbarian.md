A while ago, I read [this fluff piece][1] about [Python][2]. As with most fluff pieces, it was _quite_ inane, but our anthropologist wunderkind Joe &#8220;Zonker&#8221; Brockmeier succeeded in citing Guido van Rossum incorrectly as &#8220;Rossum&#8221; instead of &#8220;Van Rossum&#8221; no less than six different times.

I went through the very tedious process of registering for a login at the offending site in order to post my thoughts in the talkback forum on this embarrassing faux pas. My post **never** appeared in the talkback forum, **but:** all except one of the incorrect citations were silently fixed.

Two things irk me: Joe &#8220;International-Cultures-and-Customs-Specialist&#8221; Brockmeier could at the very least have made mention of the corrections in the talkback forum and/or posted my entry. To add insult to injury, he **still** has one incorrect citation.

Lord, thank you very much for not incarnating me as Joe &#8220;I am an idiot, but will do my damnedest to conceal the fact, yet still fail miserably&#8221; Brockmeier.
