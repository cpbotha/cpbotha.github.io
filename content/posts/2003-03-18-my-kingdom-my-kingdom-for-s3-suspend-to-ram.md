After spending (wasting) this whole evening hacking on the disassembled ACPI machine language ripped from the firmware of my laptop (ACPI assembly language is strange), studying the stupid [ACPI 2.0 specification][1] and mucking around in the code of the latest BitKeeper snapshot of the latest 2.5 development Linux kernel, I am still no closer to a usable S3 suspend to RAM. The sleep button simply refuses to wake the laptop up: Maybe that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s called a sleep button.

I am starting to suspect that the writers of the firmware did a terribly half-arsed job. Durnit.
