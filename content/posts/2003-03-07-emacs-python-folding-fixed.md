By making use of the outline minor mode of Emacs, one can do Python code folding. However, it seems [MOST of the available .emacs examples][1] illustrating this are broken, as youâ€™ll find if you try to use them on any Python code longer than three lines.

[Here][2] is a _correct_ example, thanks to me and goof.
