Because I am supposed to be writing my thesis, the WAB-side has been calling very insistently. Well, every so often, it’s just too much and I have to WAB for an hour or two. A great place to WAB is my baby^H^H^H^Hsoftware, called DeVIDE, which is a kind of a thingy with which you can do visualisation and image processing thingies easily. That is, if it doesn’t crash. Oh wait, it never crashes. \*cough\*

In any case, today I spent some time on the connection routing in the graph editor. In <a data-rel="lightbox-image-0" data-rl_caption="" data-rl_title="" href="http://visualisation.tudelft.nl/~cpbotha/thingies/devideSplines_vs_Straight.png" title="">this screenshot</a>, we have spline-based routing on the left and the normal straight line routing on the right. The spline routing is a new experiment. Does it look like a 4-year old built that network? What do you think?

Then of course there is the arty-farty routing mode of which a sample is available <a data-rel="lightbox-image-1" data-rl_caption="" data-rl_title="" href="http://visualisation.tudelft.nl/~cpbotha/thingies/devideArtyFartyRouting.png" title="">here</a>. For some or other wacky reason, I quite like this.

I’d be glad to hear your opinions…
