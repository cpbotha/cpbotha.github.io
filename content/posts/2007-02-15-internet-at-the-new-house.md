One of the complications of moving is that one&#8217;s internet connection can take its sweet time to catch up with one&#8217;s new location. For the past two weeks, I&#8217;ve been living off 64kbit/s capped UMTS (i.e. shit-slow mobile internet) at the new place. It looks like I might be rescued in another week or so by my old and generous link!

Marvel at the glory of my ADSL order status:
