&#8220;Zimbabwe&#8217;s state grain board has impounded more than 36 000 tons of maize from commercial farmers, accusing them of hoarding, state media reported on Monday.&#8221; &#8211; see this [article][1]. Read it all, it&#8217;s a tribute to the shining intellects (NOT) of our brothers down there.

To make it even worse, 6000 tons were seized from a German-owned farm. Joseph Made, genius and agriculture minister, is quoted as saying: &#8220;We cannot have a situation where people are starving while others are withholding maize.&#8221; Hmmm, so if you have more, I can take what I want from you? I understand.

Made continues with this little gem of wisdom concerning the foreign investors: &#8220;We came up with arrangements to allow them to invest in good faith but when they start behaving like this they may have to go and invest in their own countries.&#8221; Words fail to describe the brilliance of this man. With his kind of prescience, Zimbabwe will be the most successful country in Africa yet!

So, maybe these Zimbabwean whizz-kids should have thought ahead when they started brutalising and killing the commercial farmers who USED to produce the grain that fed them? Oh wait, I probably can&#8217;t see the situation like they do, as I actually have more than one working brain-cell.
