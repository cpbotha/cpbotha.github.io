The [Acrobat Reader][1] 5.05 linux plugin just works with Mozilla 1.0rc3. Of course. :)

[Here][2] is an interesting article about why Eric S. Raymond likes [Python][3]. It&#8217;s an interesting read, whether you&#8217;re an esr fan or not.

My [VisSym 2002][4] trip to Barcelona was great fun. We made good use of the time in Spain and even spend a few nights in a [Parador][5] in Cardona. This was on the pricey side, but is definitely worth it.

The [Promedion 5600P][6] notebook (15.1&#8243; TFT 1400&#215;1050, P4 up to 2.4GHz, 400MHz FSB, 266MHz DDR RAM, ATI Radeon 7500 with 64MB DDR, etc) is actually just a [Clevo][7] 5600P. This is also sold by [Eurocom (Canada)][8] as the Monte Carlo 5600. I haven&#8217;t been able to find reports of how Linux fares on this beast. Decisions decisions&#8230;
