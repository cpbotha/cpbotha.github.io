In the week of Monday January 4 to Sunday January 10, at least the following things happened:

  * I wrote four blog posts on this blog: 
      * [Z Launcher: A breath of fresh air in the world of Android.][2]
      * [Note-taking strategy early 2016.][3]
      * [User interface boo-boo #1: Disabled controls without explanations!][4]
      * [Closure expressions in Swift.][5] This one got picked up by a really quiet corner of Reddit, and more visitors to this blog than it&#8217;s seen in a long time.
  * Less nerdy readers (HI MOM!): Please skip the nerdy posts. My personal branding consultant has advised me to post everything here, and cross-post the longer technical articles on [vxlabs.com][6].
  * Work started this week: I&#8217;m knee-deep back in C++, GLSL shader bugs, Swift, Metal and Python. FUN!
  * Four years ago, Scott Hanselman, prolific internet personality, [explained quite eloquently][7] why it&#8217;s so important that we (nerd) blog more. Also, Rian van der Merwe [wants us to use 2016 to Make the Personal Blog Great Again™][8]. Iran&#8217;s blogfather [argues that Facebook, Instagram and Twitter are smothering the open web][9]. Although I think that the above-mentioned companies have done much good in helping many new humans onto the internet (Facebook: [more than 1.5 BILLION monthly active users][10] out of 7.3 billion humans total in 2015), we do have to put much more energy into cultivating the decentralised, non-siloed parts of this fantastic network that links all of us together.

See you next week peeps, have fun!
