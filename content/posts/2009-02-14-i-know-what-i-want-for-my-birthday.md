I thought I had everything any human could ever desire.  Turns out I was completely wrong.  Please please please get me one of these for my birthday:

<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper">
<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe allowfullscreen="true" class="youtube-player" height="473" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7-KczCp0OQ4?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" style="border:0;" type="text/html" width="840"></iframe></span>
</div>

This will work _especially_ well here in the canals of Delft.  I’ll be able to arrive at work or just go about town in ultimate style.  YEAH!
