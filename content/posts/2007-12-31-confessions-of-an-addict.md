Dear readers, although you remain anonymous, I now know quite reliably that there are slightly more than two of you. This knowledge makes me insanely happy. Thank you very much for taking the time to glance at my posts every so often.

I&#8217;ve added three hopefully useful plugins to my [WordPress][1] (best blogging software EVAR) setup:

  1. Almost at the bottom of the right sidebar, you&#8217;ll find the section &#8220;Friends&#8217; latest blogs&#8221;. If you have a blog, it&#8217;s probably in my [Google Reader][2] (best aggregator EVAR, just try it, you&#8217;ll fall in love with it), in which case your latest posts will appear, via Google Reader, on my sidebar. I&#8217;ve modified the [Google Reader plugin][3] so that it can show an arbitrary feed, not just your Shared Items (see my comments on that post for more information).
  2. Right below that, I&#8217;ve added an &#8220;RSS Feed&#8221; and an &#8220;Add to Google Reader&#8221; button. If you don&#8217;t subscribe to my blog yet, but would like to, simply click on the latter if you&#8217;d like to use Google Reader to keep up to date with my postings, or the former if you&#8217;d prefer to use some other aggregator. For those of you not using aggregators yet: if you regularly read two or more blogs, it&#8217;s definitely worth using a good aggregator. [This help text][4] explains what it means to subscribe to a feed. I&#8217;ve used the [Subscribe Me plugin][5] for this.
  3. You can now also subscribe by email to the comments of a particular posting by clicking the &#8220;<label for="subscribe">Notify me of followup comments via e-mail</label>&#8221; checkbox when posting a comment. If anybody else adds new comments to that particular posting, you&#8217;ll get notified by email. You can easily unsubscribe at anytime. I&#8217;ve used the [Subscribe to Comments plugin][6] for this.

I have one more confession: It seems that I&#8217;m completely addicted to reading (especially personal) weblogs. At the moment, there are almost 60 that I track, but I&#8217;m always open to suggestions. Lemme know in the comments if there are any that I should subscribe to.

Have a great New Year&#8217;s party, and a wonderful 2008!
