This past week I was away from work, doing a nano-sabbatical in my secret lair.<figure id="attachment_1223" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1223" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://cpbotha.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/evil_lair_landscape.png" data-rel="lightbox-image-0" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title="">

I thought I was being original by dubbing my week-long self-imposed working isolation a nano-sabbatical, but [google knows better][1]. It turns out other people call their week-long sabbaticals _nano_ too. Â Durn. In any case, as you will recall I also went away on a [month-long micro-sabbatical in 2009][2], but this time I wanted to experiment with spending almost a whole work-week focusing on a single task, trying to finish a [survey article][3] I&#8217;ve been working on for almost two years. The week is now over and the article is not ready for submission yet, but it _has_ become a completely different and much improved animal during the past week. I&#8217;m a happier person too!

I would like to share with you some of the high-level conclusions I&#8217;ve drawn from this experiment:

  * Over the past years, I&#8217;ve had to get used to multi-tasking. Switching to focus mode was quite a challenge, as my reflex is to switch, switch and switch. Judicious application of [pomodori][4], killing of browser windows and general self talkings-to mostly helped. I have it mostly under control, but I&#8217;m sure I could push up my effectivity further with more practice.
  * I did manage to work quite efficiently from day one, but only by the end of the second day did I find myself in the right _frame of mind_ for writing this kind of paper. It&#8217;s one of those cases where you can work really hard, but if you&#8217;re not in the right frame of mind, you&#8217;re not being effective.
  * At the beginning of the week, I had configured a vacation email auto-reply, keeping the exact reason for my absence vague. The idea is that I would act as if I were on vacation, that is not responding to email and not taking care of any other work-related issues. Still, I couldn&#8217;t help taking care of the bare minimum of important matters, which acted as an extra distraction. I think for any sabbatical, nano to mega, it&#8217;s important where exactly you draw the line. During my 2009 sabbatical, I had the strict rule that I could only do normal work-related things during the evenings, which worked quite well.
  * By the end of the week I was completely embroiled in interesting article-related issues, with very little else interrupting my concentration. It was refreshing having almost all thought-processes dealing with one topic, instead of bouncing between too many concurrent projects.
  * I truly love the process of writing, even if it is scientific writing, which requires a different attitude regarding the structuring of one&#8217;s text and the willingness to rewrite a piece of text as many times as it&#8217;s required to get it _exactly_ right. There&#8217;s nothing like looking at a single short sentence that concisely communicates the thought _just so_.

_On the nerd front (skip to the next paragraph if you&#8217;re feeling non-nerdy): eclipse, texlipse, mercurial, jabref and dropbox make for a beautiful LaTeX editing workflow, on Linux and Windows machines. There&#8217;s nothing like continuous LaTeX builds for the gainful utilisation of the idle and overpowered CPUs in your workstation or laptop._

There will definitely be more weeks like this one just past, and perhaps even a real sabbatical in the not-too-distant future. It is unfortunate that multi-tasking has become so _de rigueur_ in modern life. There is a whole lot to be said for the zen of pouring oneself into just that one important thing.
