The current marketing conditions and long-term strategy dictate a name
change. The new name should contain at least the words “Delft”,
“Visualisation”, “Image [Processing]”, and then one of
“platform”, “framework”, “[software
environment]”.

I’m currently looking at “devise” (Delft Visualisation and
Image processing Software Environment), “devious”
(“ou” not used, the rest you can easily guess) and perhaps
“divine” (or “devine”, which I like more, because of
the infamous Devine Brown and the fact that I would be able to use acronyms
like “PIMP” for Parallel IMage Processing”) which would
stand for Delft Visualisation and Image processing Network Environment, which
is not an entirely correct description (the network environment is just one
aspect) but acceptable nonetheless.

So, what do you think? Do you have any other suggestions?
