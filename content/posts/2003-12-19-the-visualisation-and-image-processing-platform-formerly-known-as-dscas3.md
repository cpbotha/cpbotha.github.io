The current marketing conditions and long-term strategy dictate a name change. The new name should contain at least the words &#8220;Delft&#8221;, &#8220;Visualisation&#8221;, &#8220;Image [Processing]&#8221;, and then one of &#8220;platform&#8221;, &#8220;framework&#8221;, &#8220;[software environment]&#8221;.

I&#8217;m currently looking at &#8220;devise&#8221; (Delft Visualisation and Image processing Software Environment), &#8220;devious&#8221; (&#8220;ou&#8221; not used, the rest you can easily guess) and perhaps &#8220;divine&#8221; (or &#8220;devine&#8221;, which I like more, because of the infamous Devine Brown and the fact that I would be able to use acronyms like &#8220;PIMP&#8221; for Parallel IMage Processing&#8221;) which would stand for Delft Visualisation and Image processing Network Environment, which is not an entirely correct description (the network environment is just one aspect) but acceptable nonetheless.

So, what do you think? Do you have any other suggestions?
