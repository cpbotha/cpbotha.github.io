I have an Abit KT7 motherboard. I like it, except for one little thing: for some or other reason, Abit chose to mount a non-ball-bearing fan on the Northbridge chipset heatsink. Now, if you&#8217;re going to put any kind of fan in a computer, make sure it&#8217;s a ball-bearing fan, as it&#8217;s probably going to be doing its thing 24 hours per day, 7 days a week.

In anycase, this fan of mine started making an awful noise a while ago and shortly after that stopped rotating quite as fast as it should have. Because of the guarantee, I was able to get a swap-out (i.e. a new motherboard).

Well, it happened again. This time however, I did NOT feel like taking the whole computer in just to have the motherboard replaced (because of a FAN!); it&#8217;s a good vendor, but they&#8217;re kind of strict with their guarantee conditions. So, I removed the fan from the heatsink, removed the sticker from the bottom and added a drop of sewing machine oil to the axle. Sticker back on, fan screwed on the heatsink again, it&#8217;s now quiter than ever (even than when it was brand new). I&#8217;m very happy&#8230; :)
