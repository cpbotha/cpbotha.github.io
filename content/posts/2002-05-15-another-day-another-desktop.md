Since PWM, I&#8217;d gone back to fvwm2 and then back to icewm. Seemingly, that wasn&#8217;t quite enough hopping around, so I built the latest greatest [gnome 2][1] preview using the [GARNOME][2] distribution, which is a pretty cool BSD ports-ish way of building gnome 2. Well, gnome 2 looks good but isn&#8217;t there quite yet.

Soooooo, I thought that I should give [KDE][3] a try again, seeing that they&#8217;ve passed the 3.0 milestone. My oh my, it&#8217;s even prettier than 2.2 and the strange thing is that it&#8217;s quite a bit snappier as well! I have it running with [Mosfet&#8217;s][4] high performance liquid and it&#8217;s seriously drool-worthy. For a run-of-the-mill screenshot, click <a href="http://cpbotha.net/screenshots/kde3-20020515.png" data-rel="lightbox-image-0" data-rl\_title="" data-rl\_caption="" title="">here</a>. There are even debs for testing available (go to #debian-kde on openprojects.net to see where and how) so installing is a cinch.

Well, I think I&#8217;ll play around on KDE3 for at the very least a day or two, until I go install The Next Desktop(tm).

PS. Yes, actually I do get quite a lot of work done.
