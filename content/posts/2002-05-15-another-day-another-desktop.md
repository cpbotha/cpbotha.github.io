Since PWM, I’d gone back to fvwm2 and then back to icewm. Seemingly, that wasn’t quite enough hopping around, so I built the latest greatest [gnome 2][1] preview using the [GARNOME][2] distribution, which is a pretty cool BSD ports-ish way of building gnome 2. Well, gnome 2 looks good but isn’t there quite yet.

Soooooo, I thought that I should give [KDE][3] a try again, seeing that they’ve passed the 3.0 milestone. My oh my, it’s even prettier than 2.2 and the strange thing is that it’s quite a bit snappier as well! I have it running with [Mosfet’s][4] high performance liquid and it’s seriously drool-worthy. For a run-of-the-mill screenshot, click <a data-rel="lightbox-image-0" data-rl_caption="" data-rl_title="" href="http://cpbotha.net/screenshots/kde3-20020515.png" title="">here</a>. There are even debs for testing available (go to #debian-kde on openprojects.net to see where and how) so installing is a cinch.

Well, I think I’ll play around on KDE3 for at the very least a day or two, until I go install The Next Desktop(tm).

PS. Yes, actually I do get quite a lot of work done.
