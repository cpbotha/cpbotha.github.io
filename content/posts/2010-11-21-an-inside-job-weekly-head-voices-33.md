Hiatus: temporarily over.

My sleeping patterns are not quite what they used to be, mostly due to the latest manifestation of our little gene pool over here. Added to that, I&#8217;ve been really busy. Added to _that_, work has been throwing unnecessary curve-balls that have done their part in keeping me (pre)-occupied. In the end, a dash of perspective, several extremely wise friends and a generally sunny predisposition go a really long way, so here I am. :)

In this post, I&#8217;m going to touch upon the highlights of the past seven weeks (40 to 46) and I&#8217;m going to do so with bullets, seeing as I&#8217;m in a bullety-kind of mood.

  * I spent a week in Stellenbosch teaching Information Visualisation! Read all about it in [this special blog post][1].
  * The week after that my mom came to visit us. She really has the best genes.
  * I met my new work laptop: A Dell Latitude E6410 with Core i5 M540 2.53GHz CPU, 4G ram, 500G HDD, NVidia NVS 3100m GPU with 512 MB video mem. It&#8217;s a 14&#8243; latop (15.4&#8243; is a completely useless format, flame me in the comments), but due to the materials used quite heavy. I like it!
  * Another one of our STW NIG research proposals has been granted. I conceived and developed this one together with colleagues from the LUMC Departments of Anatomy, of Surgery and of Orthopaedics. The title is _High-definition Atlas-based surgical planning for Pelvic Surgery_ and we get to combine high-resolution human histology, mega-volume rendering, , biomechanical modelling and surgical simulation. With this grant we can appoint two more Ph.D. students (one in my group, one at the LUMC) for four years to work on this!!
  * The week after that I went to Salt Lake City (Utah, US and A) to attend the conference previously known as [IEEE Visualization][2]. It was AWESOME! (blog post half-written, will soon publish).
  * The week after that I had a really cool dream: I was playing high-speed catch with a bunch of people outside. The ball was randomly changing shape between rock, papers and scissors. If you wanted to catch it, you didn&#8217;t only have to be at the right place at the right time, but your hand also had to be in the right complementary configuration to catch the shape-shifting ball.
  * Now that we&#8217;re talking about dreams: _I finally saw [Inception][3] and was completely blown away._ It&#8217;s not about being complicated, it&#8217;s about being a well-told story and a fantastically filmed movie. What I positively adored, is the fact that [Nolan][4] doesn&#8217;t require much: He only needs you to believe that dreams can be shared, without giving away too many of the details of the mechanism, and then builds a marvellous story on that canvas. My absolute favourite scene was the waking up on the plane, just before the landing, almost at the end of the film. I loved the way in which the characters looked at each other, and the possible interpretations of their expressions.
  * On the topic of the Underworld gig in the Heineken Music Hall: I hope I have my voice back before my morning lecture tomorrow morning. Thank you Fantastic Friends!

That&#8217;s it kids. If you&#8217;ve come this far, you&#8217;re now mostly up to date. Please leave me a comment, it&#8217;s good for my serotonin! I hope you have a great week. To get you off to a Â good start, here&#8217;s a music video showing what an infectious idea could look like&#8230;
