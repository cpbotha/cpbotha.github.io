I am currently designing a new master-level course at the TU Delft, creatively named _Medical Visualization_, and it&#8217;s just been assigned an official course code: IN4307. Whooo!

Keep an eye out for IN4307: This 5 ECTS course will run in the 3d period (February to April) of the 2008/2009 academic year and **it&#8217;s going to rule**. I&#8217;m integrating more modern educational techniques (thank you [TU Delft BKO][1] for the inspiration) in that the whole course will be run as an interactive workshop (I lecture, you immediately try it out on your computer machine), and assessment will be based on weekly practice exercises as well as a more extensive project that will have to be orally defended at the end. In other words, **there will be no written exam**.

My goal is to produce **frikking medical visualisation ninjas** that will hit the ground running when deployed in any academic or industrial projects. I have the technology to make you <a title="Link to Daft Punk live performance" href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=oGECJP3phyY" data-rel="lightbox-video-0">harder, better, faster, stronger</a>, and I&#8217;m not afraid to use it.
