Urgh, radeon frame buffer support in 2.5.66-bk12 (that&#8217;s cutting edge with some extra blood on top) seems to be completely broken at least on my laptop. After a little searching, it seems these drivers also seem to be in the process of a complete redesign. That&#8217;s a shame, as I wanted to try and adapt Benjamin Herrenschmidt and ATI&#8217;s 2.4 kernel PowerMac power management and suspend/resume code to x86 ACPI support in 2.5.x.

Fortunately it seems that benh [is working][1] on a 2.5 version of his work. I&#8217;ll just wait patiently until there&#8217;s more news about this bit.
