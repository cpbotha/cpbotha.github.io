I saw this on [MJ&#8217;s blog][1], so I had to take [the test][2]. Without consulting any external resources whatsoever, my results were:

&#8220;Advanced
  
You scored 100% Beginner, 93% Intermediate, 93% Advanced, and 72% Expert!&#8221;

What&#8217;s even more flattering, is the following:

&#8220;Compared to users who took the test and are and in your age group:

* 100% had lower Beginner scores.
      
* 100% had lower Intermediate scores.
      
* 100% had lower Advanced scores.
      
* 100% had lower Expert scores.&#8221;

This means that I rule, literally.
