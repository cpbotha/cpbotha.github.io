I saw this on [MJ’s blog][1], so I had to take [the test][2]. Without consulting any external resources whatsoever, my results were:

“Advanced
  
You scored 100% Beginner, 93% Intermediate, 93% Advanced, and 72% Expert!”

What’s even more flattering, is the following:

“Compared to users who took the test and are and in your age group:

* 100% had lower Beginner scores.
      
* 100% had lower Intermediate scores.
      
* 100% had lower Advanced scores.
      
* 100% had lower Expert scores.”

This means that I rule, literally.
