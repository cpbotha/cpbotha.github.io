Dear two people reading this blog on a good day: Spread the word, the Weekly Head Voices is making a comeback!

In the process of dealing with recent(ish) [life-changing decisions][1], but probably more due to the preceding time of introspection, I was unable to enter the right state of mind for producing the weekly WHV episodes. However, because exciting new events have been scheduled for the coming months and I really look forward to writing about them, and because I&#8217;ve decided that, yes, I shouldn&#8217;t worry **too** much about the actual literary impact of this here blog (I wrote &#8220;bog&#8221; first, I hope that it wasn&#8217;t a Freudian slip; what I was actually intending to say between these parentheses is that I will continue to do my best to entertain and/or edify!), the time has come to get the WHV back on the road!

For the past weeks, I have been burning all kinds of midnight oil on different projects. For one of them, I&#8217;ve had to design a reusable JS architecture for customizable visualizations (of course using the awesome [d3.js][2]). During one of these weeks, I saw a rip-off of the [following tweet, the original 140 character guide to the creative process][3]:<figure id="attachment_1797" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1797" style="width: 491px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

The stages of the creative process are: _1) This is going to be awesome 2) This is hard 3) This is terrible 4) I&#8217;m terrible 5) Hey, not bad 6) That was awesome._

At that time, I found myself squarely in stage 4: **I AM TERRIBLE.**

However, just reading this and then realising that that&#8217;s just how it has to work made me feel much better. Fast-forward to a week or so later, and I seem to find myself in stage 5. Stage 5 is not the best, but man does it feel infinitely better than stage 4. (If you run into me at any of the numerous bars, parties and other social events I frequent, ask me about the design.) Remember this process the next time you&#8217;re in the middle of something complicated.

_(I was not able to come up with any kind of bridge between the creative process and my next point. I&#8217;m open to suggestions in the comments! For now, just imagine some pithy or really clever literary topic-jumping device here, ok?)_

As the more astute readers should know (I guess that&#8217;s both of you), _I_ was naturally into mindfulness before it got all hip. See my 2011 post on [drowning in the now][5], and my 2010 post on [focus][6] if you don&#8217;t believe me. However, I wanted to get into it more formally, so I acquired and started practising with one of the better books on the topic:Â [_Mindfulness: A practical guide to peace in a frantic world_][7]. There are at least two things I really like about mindfulness:

  1. There&#8217;s quite a bit of solid research on mindfulness and its effects on your brain. See for example the publications on [the website of Prof. Mark Williams][8], first author of the book above.
  2. The idea that practising different ways of applying one&#8217;s intellect (conventional _doing_ vs. the mindful _being_) leads to the ability to enter these modes at will, thus getting more control over one&#8217;s emotions, especially appeals to me. (Click [here][9] to meet one of my most important role models. For real.)

The mindfulness book also discusses research on the interaction between one&#8217;s body and one&#8217;s emotional state. If you&#8217;re feeling down, your body starts acting up. Conversely, your physical state has a significant influence your emotional state. The upshot of this is that if you put a smile on your face, even if you&#8217;re not feeling particularly upbeat, **_Science_** says that you&#8217;ll really start to feel happier. If you&#8217;re already happy, it&#8217;s just going to consolidate those good vibes.

With that in mind, here&#8217;s my simple suggestion for today (and the rest of the year, and maybe next year): Let&#8217;s all smile as often as we can!
