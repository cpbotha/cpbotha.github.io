You could have set your watch by the appearance of this weekly blog post! Enjoy it while you can. 

Here&#8217;s a random photo from my week: <figure style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://cpbotha.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/wpid-millhouse\_kitchen\_plank.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-image-0" data-rl\_title="" data-rl\_caption="" title="">![][1]</a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">I finally figured out what planking is.</figcaption></figure>

    Note-taking and todo system chaos (NERD WARNING).
  </h2>
  
  <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
    <p>
      My email-note-taking-todo-system is again slowly morphing into something strange and unknown. I <a href="http://noeskasmit.com/comparison-of-task-managers-rtm-astrid-wunderlist-todoist/#comment-71">once called</a> using <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a> for task management &#8220;the time management connoisseur equivalent of lying in the gutter with a cheap bottle of wine in a brown paper bag&#8221;.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Well either I was just plain wrong, or I&#8217;m lying in that gutter again and I just don&#8217;t realize it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Because I became very frustrated with all the task systems that I tried (and committed to) because all of them (including the one I designed together with big G) insist on presenting all of my tasks in neat little project-grouped or deadline-ordered lists, whilst my brain is a chaotic spread-out network that wishes to see <i>everything</i> at the same time, preferably spread out and very visual, I&#8217;m back to using a giant Trello board (that <a href="http://vxlabs.com/2014/08/08/driving-the-dell-u2713hm-at-2650x1440-from-the-hdmi-output-of-the-acer-v3-571g/">2560&#215;1440 monitor</a> is very slowly earning its keep).
    </p>
    
    <p>
      It&#8217;s perhaps better than it sounds: When I process mail on my phone or in my Emacs, I forward the ones that need action to a secret Trello address which turns said mail into a Trello card in the &#8220;incoming&#8221; list of my tasks board, including all email attachments and images. Sometimes I&#8217;m naughty, and I reply to the sender summarising the list of actions I will attempt to undertake, and then Bcc that reply to Trello.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      On that Trello board I have lists for reminding me of the important projects I have to remember to work on, and then lists for <code>ASAP</code>, <code>This week</code>, <code>Later (scheduled)</code> and <code>Someday / ideas</code>. I also have lists called <code>Done (week WEEKNUM)</code> into which I can move cards once I&#8217;ve taken care of them. After a few weeks, I archive the whole <code>done</code> list of a particular week for posterity. It also doesn&#8217;t hurt that <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.trello">the Trello Android app</a> is quite beautiful.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      On the notes front, I&#8217;m currently very much in love with <a href="http://orgmode.org/">Emacs org-mode</a>, as you might have guessed from <a href="http://cpbotha.net/2014/11/20/weekly-head-voices-85-gone-south/">last week&#8217;s WHV</a>. What I did not mention then, is that I now also have a date-stamped .org jourrnal for each project that I&#8217;m working on. From each general daily .org journal I link to the various project journal .org files for that day. Based on these daily / project-based log files, I can generate high-quality LaTeX reports, <a href="http://vxlabs.com/2014/06/16/level-sets-the-practical-10-minute-introduction/">technical blog posts</a> and even presentations, if only I can remember the exact sequence of 17 emacs keyboard shortcuts to do so. As mentioned previously, I use <a href="https://github.com/cpbotha/deft-turbo">deft-turbo</a> to navigate my notes database.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I still dream of an even more graphical and non-linear way of doing all of this.

    Musings on beards (REAL MEN WARNING).
  </h2>
  
  <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
    <p>
      Besides being the sign of a true man, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beard#The_.22Philosopher.27s_beard.22">the internet says</a> that the beard was &#8220;seen as the defining characteristic of the philosopher; philosophers had to have beards, and anyone with a beard was assumed to be a philosopher&#8221;. Based on extensive research, I can assure you that this is still the case.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      On a slightly more serious note, I might be getting slightly beard-rospective, because my hairy face-friend might really have to disappear soon. I&#8217;m going to have to do my part in an academic committee or two, and I&#8217;m going to have to cross borders into the EU. The former might not be such an issue, but my current slightly middle-eastern look might not be the best option in terms of the latter.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In any case, before I reluctantly join the shaven masses, I would like to share with you two realizations from the perspective of a weirdly bearded man.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In my town, there are no hipsters. There probably will never be. That, plus the fact that I deviate significantly from the text-book hipster look, means I get recognized everywhere I go. I think this is partly due to appearing different from most other people I would normally be pigeon-holed with. Subtly complementary to this is the fact that my face has become a kind of a graphical icon of itself: If you were to take a photo of it, and you were to scale it down to 32&#215;32 pixels, you&#8217;d probably still be able to recognize it. The upshot of this is that even when I&#8217;ve visited a restaurant or caf√© only once, the next time, weeks afterwards, I am treated like a long-time regular. That&#8217;s pretty cool.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      More important than this, is the fact that people now experience difficulty applying their pigeon-holing mechanism. Around these parts, there is far too much assumed piece-wise homogeneity. In other words, people are used to believing that they are able to stereotype you after one look. I have now experienced that when I have contact with locals, their little stereotyping sensors start smoking a little bit and then fizzle out. There is usually a short moment of panic, but then we start afresh, which is nice.

      I would like to leave you with this track from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/While(1_Is_Less_Than_2)">deadmau5&#8217;s latest album</a>. I&#8217;m doing this, because it&#8217;s an extremely surprising album. You should definitely listen to the whole work, but this track should serve as an example of the <i>while (1<2)</i> surprise.
