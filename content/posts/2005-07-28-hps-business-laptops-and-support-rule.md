Yesterday morning, my laptop refused to start up. No bios, no boot, not good…

Fortunately the HP NC6000 is a business laptop, so it came standard with a 3-year international on-site warranty. I phoned HP support and within 10 minutes they had scheduled an HP engineer to come by today. This morning the engineer appeared with a new system board. In no time flat he had disassembled the whole laptop, replaced the system board and re-assembled the whole dang thing. Kaching, one working laptop.

HP support here in NL is top notch. If you have the choice, look seriously at their business laptops for your next purchase…
