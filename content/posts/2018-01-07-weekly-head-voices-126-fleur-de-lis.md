  * Happy new year everyone, and welcome to the first _Weekly_Â (truly?! will this be the year?) Head Voices of 2018!
  * I ended 2017 with a longish (by my standards) run in the morning, followed by a laid-back mini-party and finally by struggling really hard to stay awake until midnight.
  * In contrast, returning to the office on January 2 was a pretty good way to ease gradually into work in 2018. Many colleagues were still on vacation, so the week felt a bit like work with training wheels.
  * Pro-tip #1 for the new year: In the last few weeks of 2017 I started (again&#8230;) explicitly making quiet time at the start of the day to think about what I want to take care of. These take the form of a small number of [Org mode][1] &#8220;`- [ ] Do this thing`&#8221; checklist items that are usually related to but separate from my main tasks. I find it amazing to which extent these few minutes are able to shape my day. (In my org mode monthly journal, I also usually start by listing out manually the tasks I want to complete during that month, as well as the ideas / thoughts / principles I want to keep in my sights.)
  * Pro-tip #2 for the new year: After years of resisting these types of software tools due to my belief that I should simply apply more grit and will power to squeeze out more focus hours, I finally broke down and purchased the [macOS app called Focus][2]. You click its pretty icon, and then your computer goes into focus mode: The Mail application and a bunch of other non-focus-related apps all get killed, and a bunch of websites (reddit, youtube, work chat, etc) are blocked for a user-configurable block of time. I rationalised this purchase with the following reasoning: _It usually takes a single moment of weakness for a distraction to terminate a valuable block of focus. It takes a single moment of strength for this tool to start a valuable block of focus._
  * Although I&#8217;m having fun, I really don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m supposed to use bullets like this.
  * Thank you very much for spending time here with me. I wish you a week of value and focus, followed by a visit to the next WHV!<figure id="attachment_2981" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2981" style="width: 840px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://cpbotha.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/huguenot_monument_franschhoek.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-image-1" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title="">
