Yaaaay, my first weblog entry. Today I spent most of my time researching fast-marching methods (which I now more or less fully grasp) and level-set methods (which are related to fast-marching methods, but somewhat more involved, and thus these are taking me a bit longer to assimilate). Eventually, I&#8217;ll be juggling around a few hyper-surfaces to see how these methods fare on some of my more hairy data.
