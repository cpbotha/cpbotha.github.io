Hopefully this will help me to cut down on my WAB[1] activities&#8230; an extremely groovy RSS/ATOM newsfeed aggregator plugin for Mozilla Firefox. See the screenshot <a href="http://visualisation.tudelft.nl/~cpbotha/thingies/sageScreenShot2.png" data-rel="lightbox-image-0" data-rl\_title="" data-rl\_caption="" title="">here</a> and download the extension, called Sage, [here][1].

[1] Work Avoidance Behaviour; you know, you&#8217;re supposed to start working, so first you clean up your desk, then clean up the room, then the house, then you take up gardening or perhaps embroidering&#8230; in my case, I spend far too much time reading nerdy web sites instead of finishing this little story I started writing.
