I finally broke down and ordered that laptop: Promedion</a> ([Clevo][1]) 5600 with Northwood P4 1.8GHz CPU, 256MB DDR ram, 30G HDD, [64MB ATI Mobility Radeon 7500][2], 15&#8243; 1400&#215;1050 TFT, 3 year on-site.

When I get the thing, which should be in a week or so, I&#8217;ll make sure to write up a detailed review and document the laptop&#8217;s transcendence to the next level of computer consciousness (i.e. the Linux installation). Fortunately I didn&#8217;t have to pay the Microf*ck tax (the forced inclusion of a Microslop OS) like with so many other mainstream notebooks.
