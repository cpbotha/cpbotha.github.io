I get to work at home today. Yaaaay!

Read this [Salon article][1] about Mozilla; it&#8217;s reasonable and down to earth. Also remember to IGNORE any links to MozillaQuest that you ever come across: the guy behind it is an absolute moron. Don&#8217;t confuse MozillaQuest (urgh) with [MozillaZine][2], which is good. I&#8217;m test driving Mozilla 0.9.9, and I must say that it&#8217;s impressive. One day, all this browser pain will be behind us. We just have to kick more &#8220;web-designers&#8221; into submission with regards to being compliant with [HTML standards][3].

Today I will continue preparation for my great n-dimensional TF domain extravaganza. Remember kids, [Python][4] is healthy for you!
