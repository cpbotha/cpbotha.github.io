_(Warning: This post has an extremely high backyard philosophy content. Will probably greatly offend any real philosophers, and a bunch of other people I probably have not even thought about.)_ 

I recently became middle-aged. As part of the thank you I wrote for the many kind words people posted to my facebook wall, I made a short summary of the things I had learned over the past N years. I hope you don&#8217;t mind that I post them here as well:

Since that note (I&#8217;ve skipped a number of weekly posts here as you might have noticed; really really busy) I have also been thinking about the relationship between one&#8217;s happiness, one&#8217;s circumstances, and the plasticity of one&#8217;s self. 

I&#8217;ll start this little story with me during a coffee-induced zen moment:

Zen is a real thing that you can read about on [wikipedia][1], in a billion blogs and also in <a href="http://youtu.be/MOXQo7nURs0" data-rel="lightbox-video-0">BookBooks</a>. I don&#8217;t think that I&#8217;m deviating **too** far from the real deal when I use zen to describe any form of personal enlightenment, or that elevated state of self I should be striving for every moment of every day, but mostly forget to do because I get caught up in life as, ironically, I am not yet zen enough. 

Sometimes, I find myself in a perfect little moment of warmth and humanity with close friends or family (and/or with a perfect coffee) and I am somehow able to observe and appreciate the moment in real-time from a spot somewhere outside of the conversation, for example while I&#8217;m walking to school with my daughter on a spring morning and realise that life in these simple moments is even greater than I thought. Sometimes I am briefly able to distance myself from some perceived life complexity, a distance from which everything actually looks pretty fine and then turns out to be exactly that. Was it that way to start with, did it change, or did I change? 

I think being able to take a few (or a thousand) steps back in order to better see yourself and your situation is related to one of the few fundamental zen principles: Enlightenment through growing self-knowledge. I also somehow had in my mind that there was some connection between zen and the principle of mind like water, or _mizo no kokoro_ if you prefer its prettier ring. In searching for this link, I stumbled onto [this Bruce Lee quote][2]: 

> You must be shapeless, formless, like water. When you pour water in a cup, it becomes the cup. When you pour water in a bottle, it becomes the bottle. When you pour water in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Water can drip and it can crash. Become like water my friend. 

During those occasional and coincidental flashes of increased perception I mentioned above the quote, when I was both in the experience and outside, at a good distance, I was able to look inwards and see how I could best change _me_ to suit the situation better. The better I suit the situation, the more it agrees with me. Harmony. 

Let me restate that: Most often I am not able to change my environment. However, I am apparently able to train my ability to change _me_, which in many cases can lead to the same desired harmonious outcome. 

So, sort of in addition to the things I&#8217;ve learned over the past years, here are the things I strive to have cultivated when I grow up: 

<ul class="org-ul">
  <li>
    Mindfulness, of me, the human beings I am fortunate to be surrounded with and all of the interactions between us. This includes the ability to take a thousand steps back, and to see clearly.
  </li>
  <li>
    A mind like water, not to do kung fu fighting, but to be able to change and flow continuously to contribute more to harmony and happiness.
  </li>
</ul>

Because I&#8217;m not sure how else to do this, I&#8217;m ending this story with a photo of a beer that I took during a really sunny zen moment:
