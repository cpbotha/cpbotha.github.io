I’m in browser heaven. I bought [Codeweavers][1] Crossover 1.1.1 for a measly $24.95, so now my already hard-core [Mozilla][2] 1.0rc2 can also make use of all the winblows browser plugins, such as Quicktime, Windows Media Player 6.4 (ugh), Flash 6, Shockwave and so on. This is a great piece of software and it’s stable too!

Did you know that “xam = reduce(operator.add, map(operator.mul, xa, xa)) ** .5” calculates the magnitude of n-element vector xa? I had to wipe away a tear when I wrote that. It’s fast too. To run an interesting python benchmark, download [this][3].
