One day, we&#8217;ll have a usable browser. Opera is fine, but the new b7 release for linux crashes a tad too often. It seems after all that mozilla, in spite of being HUGE, is the best we have. Actually, with the price of RAM at the moment, it&#8217;s not that bad a browser choice.

This weekend was a social occasion of note (yes, geeks have these too). PhotoPoint, where I used to keep all my photos, has decided to start charging for their services. It&#8217;s a really good service, but in this case I scripted something in python and sh which serves my purposes quite well. This also happened during the weekend (only geeks may do this type of thing during social occasions of note).
