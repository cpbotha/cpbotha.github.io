[This article][1] in Wired documents the efforts of a scientist to restore sight with brain implants and external signal processing and optical acquisition equipment. It also mentions the work of one or two other scientists in the field.

I read Neuromancer years ago and it was very good. I read it very recently again and suffered a severe attack of goose-flesh. Gibson&#8217;s visions of the future are super-naturally accurate: if you haven&#8217;t read this book yet, stop what you&#8217;re doing now and start. You&#8217;ll see that virtual reality (AFAICR, Gibson coined the term &#8220;cyberspace&#8221;), brain implants, artificial human augmentation and artificial intelligence are all there and that the current state of affairs is excitingly close to the bleak picture that Gibson paints. I hope I live long enough to see where it ends&#8230;
