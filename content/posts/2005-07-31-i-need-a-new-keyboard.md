I just realised why I don’t really LIKE my keyboard at home… I used to type on [Microsoft Natural Elite][1] keyboards, at home and at work. These were great: split layout, great feel and affordable.

Eventually, it was time to replace my keyboard at home. I bought the [Microsoft Natural Multimedia][2] keyboard, thinking it would offer more of the same typing goodness. Unfortunately, as is the case with good things, and especially good things in Microsoft’s possession, they come to and end. These keys have the new patented Spongy Feel(tm). The major feature is that it sucks.

It seems that the Natural Elite (or Pro) is unfortunately not available in NL anymore. I’ll probably have to renovate one of my old Elites, but this is not really a long-term solution.

Does anyone know of any other split layout keyboard that has almost the same key feel as the old Natural Elite or Pro? Lemme know…
