Welcome back everyone!

It's clear to me that I have to get back in the WHV saddle, but preaching sure
is easier than practising, and so I thought it might be a good idea to try and
[bullet-list](/tags/bullet-lists/) myself back into it.

(When I say "bullet-list" I mean "helpfully named hierarchical sections",
because [Emacs](/tags/emacs/) tends to frown quite disapprovingly at mere bullet lists. Here I
am after the _intention_ of the bullet-list, namely to _just get on with it_.)

It is important to mention that this post attempts to cover time up to
Wednesday, August 23, 2023.


## Running {#running}

My running habit has been steadily returning to its pre-op state, both in terms of
fitness but, more importantly, in terms of joy.

Also, my sixth pair of Altra Escalantes (version 3.0) recently arrived. I
wanted black ones, as I usually recycle old Altras after their recommended
700km or so into super comfortable office shoes, but my supplier was out of
stock and so I ended up with these surprisingly attractive blue and red ones:

In more good news, it turns out that it's [entirely OK if you spend all of your
minimum of 2.5 weekly hours of exercise during the weekend](https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/news/20230719/your-heart-benefits-even-if-you-exercise-as-a-weekend-warrior).

Personally, I usually manage to fit in two shorter runs during the week, and a
longer run during the weekend, for a desired total of 25km per week, but I have
always wondered if it was in fact required to exercise on every day of the week
for maximal health benefit.

P.S. My main motivation is the unqualified joy of the run and not so much the
health benefits, although the benefits sure are nice!

P.P.S. [25km per week was my resolution for 2023](/2023/01/01/the-2022-to-2023-transition-post/#running), but that plan was quite rudely
torpedoed by my [prostate cancer adventure a few months ago](/2023/07/01/weekly-head-voices-252-prostate-cancer/), so now I just try
to make it week by week.


## GenAI {#genai}

For the past months, I've been going deeper and deeper into generative AI, and
more specifically large language models (LLMs), down to the nuts and bolts and
let's-get-Llama-2-70-billion-quantized-and-running-on-my-PC levels.

Here are a few things that I really liked learning about:

-   Although it has indeed been a longer journey, the current GenAI explosion /
    hype seems to have been ignited in the third quarter of 2022, with the open
    source release of Stable Diffusion in August, and the birth of ChatGPT in
    November.
-   For the largest part, the most powerful LLMs have been trained, on hundreds
    of billions to trillions of words, how to predict the next / missing word of
    an incomplete document. After enough of this, they appear to gain some sort
    of reasoning capability, including being able to answer theory of mind
    questions.
    -   There are striking similarities to how humans interpret speech.
-   Almost all of the currently famous models (Stable Diffusion, Whisper, all
    current LLMs) are based on a specific type of neural network called a
    Transformer, introduced in the paper _Attention Is All You Need_, published by
    Ashish Vaswani and fellow Google researchers in 2017.

For many more details about these, and other hopefully interesting
observations, please come to one of my GenAI talks!

GenAI developments are continuing at a truly impressive pace, and now I hope
that we (personally) can also start showing some practical and useful
applications!

P.S. Read the brilliant Lyn Alden's latest newsletter [Six AI Themes to Consider](https://www.lynalden.com/august-2023-newsletter/)
in which she discusses how AIs (actually LLMs) are already starting to use
bitcoin (lightning) to pay for services (soon other AIs and also humans) in
order to complete their tasks.


## Lowlands 2023 {#lowlands-2023}

One could say that the WHV series owes its life to a certain 3-day festival in
the Netherlands as [it was born in the sweet afterglow of the 2009 edition](/2009/08/29/starting-today-head-voices-every-week/).

However, due to the strict WHALLSALL privacy policy, you will find only
[pleasant echoes of the experience](/tags/lowlands/) in a number of posts on this blog.

This time it felt even more special, because it's the first time that I was
able to go since [all the way back in 2019](/2019/09/01/weekly-head-voices-176-cycle-of-life/).

I was pleasantly shocked by the warm _familiarity_ of my other home, starting all
the way from the airport in Cape Town, joining hundreds of Dutchies returning
home after their vacations in SA, to arriving in NL and letting that lovely
language permeate my neural network, all through the festival chaos and
sometimes extremely close proximity to tens of thousands of locals, to walking
and cycling under the late summer sun, to spending the highest possible quality
time with my friends there.

Again I am left overflowing with gratitude.

Thank you other home, and eternal thank you friends!


## I am a function {#i-am-a-function}

Back in [WHV #70 from 2014](/2014/05/07/weekly-head-voices-70-patterns-in-the-sand/), based on some reading about the turnover of matter
in humans, I came to the following conclusion:

> Now I see us all as nothing more than the continuously changing patterns that
> form briefly in the grains of sand of the universe. Winds blow grains of sand
> around, now taking part in one pattern and then in another. At some point, your
> body has contained parts of your best friend, and of your worst enemy. The
> patterns change continually; sometimes they fade away, and sometimes new
> patterns emerge.

In the intervening years, reader KvG first introduced me to [Alan Watts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Watts), noting
that they saw similar themes in our writing.

I am wording it carefully here, as I obviously can't really compare my backyard
philosophical attempts to the work of Alan Watts, which I have now come to know
better.

That story was required to bring us to this, the concluding quote of this post:

> You are a function of what the whole universe is doing in the same way that a
> wave is a function of what the whole ocean is doing. -- Alan Watts

I really love that.
