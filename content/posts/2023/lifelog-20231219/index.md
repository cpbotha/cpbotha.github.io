-   Made a Zapier _Zap_ to send new cpbotha.net posts (picked up via RSS) to a Telegram bot called HeadVoices who lives on [a Telegram (announce-only) channel named "cpbotha.net blog"](https://t.me/cpbothanet).
    -   I have not (yet) been able to pipe the post's HTML to the telegram API so you can read more of the post there, because [Telegram's HTML mode](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#html-style) is quite limited, and I would have to figure out to sanitise my post's HTML. Don't think it's worth the effort.
    -   My idea here was to show more ways in which folks can get cpbotha.net content, if they really want to, on the communication channel of their choice.
        -   RSS and email remain first class citizens, but people do like their social apps!
        -   It looks like [RSS to Mastodon is also doable](https://www.jessesquires.com/blog/2022/12/15/rss-to-mastodon/), although the Zapier way would not be as free as IFTTT or just running curl from cron. BTW, IFTTT seems to support only two active applets in the free version.
        -   I'm getting serious rabbit hole feelings here, but do let me know if there are other channels where you would like to be notified of new posts.
-   After a few hours of driving, we ended up in Wilderness, one of our favourite places in the world.
    -   Braai with long time great friends.
