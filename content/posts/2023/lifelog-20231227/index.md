-   Pack up and drive back home
-   Lovely lovely family lunch at [The Drydock restaurant](https://www.drydock.co.za/) in Knysna
-   During the last part of the drive my partner took over, and I could spend some time updating <https://github.com/cpbotha/org-roam-similarity> to support `multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1`, a much smaller and faster transformer-based similarity model. See <https://www.sbert.net/docs/pretrained_models.html> for more details.
-   It seems I do always need to be building something. It is one of the building blocks of my well-being.
-   That thought led to me spending some more time thinking about more clearly defining my personal values. You could take a look at the [personal life systems](/2021/01/10/the-2020-to-2021-transition-post/#life-systems-2021) I wrote up at the start of 2021. They are the backbone of everything, while my personal values are a list of more concrete priorities that cover different subsets of my life systems.
