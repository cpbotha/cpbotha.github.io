-   Christmas Eve everyone!
-   Just realized that my trick of setting `default-dir` does work for the temporary org file and output html file that `ox-pandoc` creates, but of course all image links will break, as they are relative to the actual location of the source org files. 😭 (this means I will have to redo everything via the temporary buffer after all)
-   A simply brilliant late afternoon at the beach with the whole family, and even squeezed in a short barefoot run on the beach.
-   Car battery was so much on the edge that a phone forgotten on the USB charge cable managed to push it over said edge, and so car refused to start. A minute or two before a friend arrived with jumper leads, a random kind stranger with a truck and jumper leads offered to help and did!
-   I do need to emphasise what a sublime day this was. So much joy!
