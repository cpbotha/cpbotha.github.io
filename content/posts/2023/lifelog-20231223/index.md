-   First thing, could not resist taking another quick peek at ox-pandoc and figured out  that it honours `default-directory`, so instead of trying to find the last `*pandoc <N>*` buffer it created, I can just write to a file in a temporary directory
-   difficult 12km run in St Francis. Wind, heat and that durn hip niggle. Year goal is starting to slip out of reach... I'll deal.
-   Made use of perplexity.ai offer of two months free: <https://www.threads.net/@perplexity.ai/post/C1KquV6gyWd>
-   Spent a substantial amount of time struggling with AppleScript, Notes and Emacs, and I'm not sure yet how I feel about all of this. <https://github.com/cpbotha/org-roam-to-apple-notes> is out there for other people to learn about all the ways in which this can fail.
