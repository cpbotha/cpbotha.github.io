Welcome to the first regular Weekly Head Voices of the year folks!

This, the 251st edition, looks back at the week from Monday, January 2 to
Sunday, January 8 of the brand new year 2023.

You might recall from the 2023 transition post that appeared a mere week ago,
that [I really wanted to try to post more regularly here](/2023/01/01/the-2022-to-2023-transition-post/#quo-vadis-2023), even if it meant that
the posts might be less substantial.

Well here we are: A short post that is on time!

(The proposed blogging pipeline improvements that were also mentioned are still in progress (AKA I have
not yet started).)


## GOU #1 is back from .de! {#gou-1-is-back-from-dot-de}

The biggest news of the week is that GOU #1 has returned from a month-long
[FSA exchange](https://fsa-youthexchange.co.za/) visit to Essen, in Germany.

We really missed her, but she's back after an experience-packed four weeks with
an amazing host family, living her best life as she has this obvious talent to
do.


## A tonne of fun in week one {#a-tonne-of-fun-in-week-one}

Due to possibly debatable life decisions, I returned to work on Monday,
January 3.

There are perks to starting up so early in the year, primarily that it's quite
peaceful, and there's a bit more headspace than normal to think about bigger
plans for the year ahead.

Sadly, I have not yet made any break-throughs in this regard.

Partially this is due to a substantial number of my mental cycles having to go
into a data-science project that requires my attention, and partially because I
have not yet taken that deep-thinking-walk.

I'll get on that walk tomorrow!

In spite of work, we did manage to fit in a whole bunch of fun in this first
week:

-   We squeezed in a sneaky but sublime school night sunset dinner at Millhouse
    Kitchen on Lourensford Farm to celebrate our anticipation of GOU #1's return
    the next day.
-   We made a family outing of a trip to the V&amp;A Waterfront on Saturday to return
    an Adoozy powerbank that they saved abovementioned GOU's phone with at OR
    Tambo airport in Johannesburg. Their rental powerbank concept looks
    interesting, and the people were really super helpful, but their network in
    Cape Town is a bit anaemic with the main issue that you can't return your
    powerbank at Cape Town airport!
    -   During this outing, we had lunch at [Den Anker](https://denanker.co.za/) where we always enjoy
        culinary and cultural echoes of our other home. In my case, this includes
        the taste of my favourite Trappist beer, namely [the Rochefort](/tags/rochefort/). On this
        beautiful sunny day, I opted for and limited myself to the lighter #6. (I
        and some of my friends have been known to enjoy all of those even numbers
        in sequence.)
-   On Sunday, we (famjam) made use of the absolutely fabulous weather and spent
    a glorious day in Betty's Bay, mostly on its main beach. I'm currently
    reading [Liu
    Cixin's Supernova Era](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43263225-supernova-era) and the story, with its pretty inventive premise, has
    just switched up a few gears.
    -   The ocean views from [Clarence Drive](/2017/01/20/weekly-head-voices-114-so-you-know-what-i-did-last-summer/) were truly breath-taking today. They
        were so over-the-top beautiful that GOU #1 exclaimed at least once that
        they "look like a rendering", which struck me as a really remarkable
        compliment. (This was followed by some joking in the car about all of _this_
        [being a simulation](https://www.simulation-argument.com/).)

Have a great week friends, I hope to see you again on the other side!
