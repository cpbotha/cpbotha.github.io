Welcome  back everyone!

My excuse this time for the multi-month WHV blogging hiatus is that I was
dealing with prostate cancer.

I was diagnosed in February, but I wanted to wait for calmer waters before
writing anything.

Extremely fortunately, those calmer waters have arrived, and now I can talk
openly.

I wanted to write up this whole story firstly because this blog has a long
history of stories about significant life events, but also just in case it
could help anyone else who might find themselves in a similar boat and would
like to talk. If you are such a person, please [email me](https://cpbotha.net/about/) or leave a comment down
below.

On to the story:


## Discovery {#discovery}

In January my GP randomly tacked on a PSA (Prostate Specific Antigen) test to
the [Apolipoprotein B (ApoB) blood test](https://apob.app/about), which at that point still was the main
topic of our interest.

The tacked-on PSA came back at 6.5ug/L, which is _convincingly_ above the range
for my age, and hence was suddenly promoted to The Main Topic of Interest.

Three weeks later a repeat test at the urologist came back even a tad higher,
and so I was scheduled for a prostate biopsy two weeks after that.

This procedure, fortunately under general anaesthesia, is where the urologist
sticks a number of needles into one's prostate in order to gather actual tissue
samples that can be studied by the pathology lab.

Those biopsy results came back with...

Prostate cancer.

ULP... although my science brain had deduced that this was probably going to
be the outcome (low [CRP](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/c-reactive-protein-test/about/pac-20385228) = probably no prostatitis, few other indications of
[BPH)](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/symptoms-causes/syc-20370087), my human brain was in panic.

To be more specific about the diagnosis, it was [Gleason score 3+4 aka grade
group 2 (on the favourable side of "intermediate risk")](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/diagnosis-staging/tests/understanding-your-pathology-report/prostate-pathology/prostate-cancer-pathology.html) prostate cancer. 9
out of the 13 biopsy cores (samples) were cancerous, with both lobes of the
prostate involved.

Cue some more shock here...

After that initial shock came the more cognitive realisation (thanks science
brain!) that as cancers and cancer gradings go, this was quite... _reasonable_.

That being said, the _existential dread_ caused by this disease, which was
entirely willing and able to kill me, was quite visceral.

By the way, you know that thing about the atheists and the foxholes?

Contrary to the wisdom of the foxhole, I found _immense_ peace in my science, and
endless strength in my family and my friends.


## Surgery {#surgery}

My urologist explained that for someone at my age, with this diagnosis, he
would recommend in no uncertain terms to have the [prostate removed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostatectomy), preferably
via _robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy_, aka my new friend Wreck-it RALP
(silent H).

In my [previous career as academic in The Netherlands](/2013/03/09/dear-academia-i-hope-we-can-still-be-friends/), a significant part of my
research was computer-assisted surgery. Although I did most of my work in
orthopaedics with the academic hospital in Leiden, the Da Vinci surgical robot
(previous generation!) was very much on our radar.

Little did I know that a decade or so later I would experience its successor,
the Da Vinci X, very much first hand.

(It's hard for me to put in words how grateful I am now for all of the
thousands of hours of research and development that have gone into
robot-assisted surgery... thank you colleagues!)

On March 30, my partner and I left home at 4 AM to report at the hospital
at 5.

First that horrible open-at-the-back hospital wear, and then the warm enema
they brought in shortly after admission, were pretty clear signs that things
were getting _uncomfortably_ real.

My experience of the surgery itself was of course sublime -- oblivion is indeed
bliss!  -- thanks to the anaesthetist's magic.

The main procedure was performed by [Dr Conray Moolman](https://caperoboticsurgery.co.za/), a urological surgeon who
specialises in RALP, with hundreds of prostatectomies under the belt.

(Why yes, I am in fact now _expected_ to brandish this level of punnery, thanks
for asking.)

Having the operation done by someone with his level of experience is a best
case scenario for me personally, but the role of that experience in the
surgical outcome is underlined by much of the literature on robotic
prostatectomy.

As you can see in the handy Wikipedia illustration below, the surgeon has to
cut out the prostate and some of the surrounding tissue, and then attach the
remaining urethra to the bladder neck.

The poor urethra is just expected to stretch to the occasion.

All of this happens via the Da Vinci X's many robotic arms, a number of them
inserted into my abdominal cavity through the five incisions (four small and
one larger) in my abdomen.

One of the main challenges for the surgeon here is that, along with the whole
prostate, they need to remove as little as possible of the surrounding nerves,
which would result in certain post-operative functional deficits, but enough of
the surrounding tissue to include cancer cells that may have progressed to
there.


## Post-op {#post-op}

I was able to walk a little bit on the same afternoon, with the expert help of
the physiotherapist, and in spite of the interference of my new and fortunately
temporary augmentation the [Foley catheter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foley_catheter), which had to remain in place for at
least a week to give the new bladder-urethra hook-up time to heal.

A few days later, the first fantastic bit of news was that the post-op
pathology report, completed a few days later, showed that ["all margins were
clear"](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/positive-surgical-margins-following-radical-prostatectomy-20090617171), meaning that it was highly probable that all prostate cancer cells
had been taken care of.

I was able to return to work just over two weeks after surgery.

The first post-op PSA test 6 weeks afterwards showed a new PSA level of 0.01.

I have not been able to find out if that amount is just what the test shows at
its lower end, or if there is somehow some residual PSA left in my system.

My urologist seems happy with this result, which is important.

For the first year, I'll have to repeat this blood test every three months to
ensure that there's really nothing there. I am keeping my fingers crossed.


## Closing thoughts {#closing-thoughts}

As I write this, exactly three months after the prostatectomy, I am looking out
over the Crocodile river, at the end of [our traditional winter KNP break-away](/tags/knp/).

Shortly after the 6-week PSA test, I had to have another small surgical
procedure due to a urethral stricture which developed most probably due to the
catheter. Fortunately the stricture was very distal (ahem), far away from the
critical new urethra-bladder-neck junction.

I am almost back up to pre-surgical strength, although I do have to go to the
bathroom substantially more regularly (also at night) due to the remaining
nerves (most of them, fortunately!) still having to learn new tricks, but
probably more due to the urethral sphincter being exactly the part that is
newly sutured to the bladder neck. Other than that, my running fitness took
quite a hit, and is now in the slow process of building up again.

On the mental side, my confidence in my own health and physical resilience has
taken a bit of a knock. This is something I really need to work on.

****Through all of this, support from work, friends and family has been absolutely
phenomenal.****

Amongst many other lessons, this has shown me how much even that random
WhatsApp from a friend who I haven't seen in ages can mean, and so I have
resolved to send that random supportive message through whichever medium,
whenever there's an opportunity.
