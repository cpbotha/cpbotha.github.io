> The public&#8217;s unwillingness to learn basic scientific concepts and scientists&#8217; inability to communicate those concepts lead the public to reject promising research (such as genetic modification), ignore serious problems (such as global warming) and embrace dangerous nonsense (such as anti-vaccination rhetoric).

&#8212; Proposition from the [Ph.D. thesis][1] of Dr Wynand Winterbach, via [Francois Malan][2] on Facebook.
