As I mentioned, no lamented on, in [this post][1], it was high time for a new computer in my life.  On Saturday June 14, 2008, I managed to acquire the necessary components to construct my latest computer machine.  For you viewing pleasure, I took the photo below of the various parts lasciviously arranged:

Niiiiice!

After a truly delectable BBQ with [Really Good Friends][3], I set about putting the beast together.  At 3:00 AM it purred into life with Ubuntu Hardy Heron 8.04 x86_64: 45nm Penryn quad-core Q9450 2.6 GHz CPU on a P35-based Asus P5KC, 8 GB of RAM, GeForce 8800 GT with 512 MB, Seagate Barracude 500 GB 7200 RPM HDD, all enclosed in an Antec Sonata III Piano Black case.  All in all quite affordable at 925 eurobucks, but definitely a beast of a machine (probably at least until the end of July!).

Now I can do all sorts of sick things, like running Windows XP 64 bit in a virtual machine:

I’m the coolest nerd on my block!
