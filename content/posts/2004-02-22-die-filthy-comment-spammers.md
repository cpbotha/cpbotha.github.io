Spammers represent the lowest form of life, as we&#8217;ve established. They also seem to think it a good idea to paste meaningless comments on one&#8217;s weblog in order to promote some other website. This weekend, I deleted about 800 of these comments from my weblog. I wish these spammers all die from some extremely painful but slow-acting disease and that they also realise exactly why this is happening to them.

In anycase, whilst waiting for my wish to come true, I&#8217;ve also installed Jay Allen&#8217;s [MT-Blacklist content filter][1] for Movable Type. It should protect all blogs hosted on cpbotha.net/weblogs.

Cross yer fingers.
