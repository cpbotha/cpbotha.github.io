In other news, I was able to put time in on Friday and do some
  
[PyColourChooser hacking][1]. Michael Gilfix (the author) has integrated my patches. You know it&#8217;s a good patch when it removes far more code than it adds, yet increases the functionality. :)

I&#8217;m still wondering why wxWindows doesn&#8217;t wrap the [GTK colour wheel][2] though. The wxWindows generic colour selector (used on GTK setups) isn&#8217;t worth the photons it was coded with. PyColourChooser alleviates this deficiency in wxPython to some extent, but that durn colour wheel would have been nice too!
