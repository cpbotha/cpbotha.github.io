Today on Slashdot:

&#8220;I&#8217;m guessing that everyone here has a valid criticism of Microsoft&#8217;s attacks on, and approach towards the Open Source model. To me, that **begs the question** of what we think would be an &#8220;appropriate&#8221; reaction from Microsoft towards the Open Source model&#8230;&#8221; Article [here][1].

This always makes me grind my teeth. No, you illiterate pseudo-intellectual idiot, you can not use that phrase like that. Let me quote from <https://brians.wsu.edu/2016/05/19/begs-the-question/>Â (and the same information is available from a million other places):

&#8220;An argument which improperly assumes as true the very point the speaker is trying to argue for is said in formal logic to &#8216;beg the question.&#8217; Here is an example of a question-begging argument: &#8216;This painting is trash because it is obviously worthless.&#8217; The speaker is simply asserting the worthlessness of the work, not presenting any evidence to demonstrate that this is in fact the case. Since we never use &#8216;begs&#8217; with this odd meaning (&#8216;to improperly take for granted&#8217;) in any other phrase, many people mistakenly suppose the phrase implies something quite different: that the argument demands that a question about it be asked&#8211;raises the question. **If you&#8217;re not comfortable with formal terms of logic, it&#8217;s best to stay away from this phrase, or risk embarrassing yourself.**&#8220;

(P.S. in 2018: That last bolded sentence has been replaced with: _Although using the expression in its original sense is now rare, using it in the newer sense will cause irritation among traditionalists_. Oi.)
