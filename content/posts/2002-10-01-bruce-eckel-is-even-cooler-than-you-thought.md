As if you didnâ€™t know, Bruce Eckel is responsible for the very popular and electronically freely available and purchasable in paper form Thinking in C++ (and books about lesser languages such as Java too ;). On his FAQ page there are some interesting tidbits, such as his [opinion about Ruby compared to Python][1] and especially his [opinion about publishing his books on the web (for free) as well as in print][2].
