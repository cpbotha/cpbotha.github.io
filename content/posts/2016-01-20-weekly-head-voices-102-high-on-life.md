The week of Monday January 11 to Sunday January 17, 2016 got off to a brilliant start with a _business_ lunch at [Bodega][1], a restaurant that finds itself on the Dornier Wine Estate. The view looked something like this:

&#8230; and the company was suitably awesome. (This is not the first time that Bodega makes its appearance on this blog, or in the blog-free suburbs of my social calendar. The company might be different every time, but so far its level of awesomeness has been _quite_ consistent.)

The rest of the (work) week was consumed by extreme nerdery, which is of course the way I love it. Besides more GPU shader fine-tuning (at least once I exclaimed on the [Stone Three][2] HipChat, hopefully soon the Stone Three [Mattermost][3],  _WITNESS THE POWER OF MATH!_, before showing a rendering that was marginally better than the one where the POWER OF MATH had not yet been invoked a sufficient number of times), there was Javascript, [d3.js][4] (d3 is another fantastic example of what you can do with vectorised thinking and computation) and Python.

In break time I finally took a closer look at [C++14][5] and beyond and came away super impressed. There&#8217;s a blog post in the pipeline on generic lambda expressions, because I think they&#8217;re brilliant. I don&#8217;t know why I love different programming languages so much, but I do.

On Saturday,  I got really high with one of my besties, a superb gentleman who also goes by the name of A Very Flat Cat. We reached this altered state by the old-fashioned but extremely reliable (and cheap!) method of physically increasing our altitude via ambulation up the west peak of the [Helderberg][6]. The walk (a few hours in 35 degrees Celsius&#8230;) was exhilarating, and the view from the top awe-inspiring. Check it (click for high-res):

I&#8217;ve often wondered about the effect of one&#8217;s surroundings on one&#8217;s mindfulness. This was one of those cases where mother nature, without asking for permission or anything like that, simply brute-forced the _being_ switch with her astonishing beauty. Very grateful I was.

Have a great week friends, see you on the other side!
