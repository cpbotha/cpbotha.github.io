[Ed][1] does have a way with words, but what did you expect? In this [posting][2], he points out another example of the fact that this stupid war is all about economics. Once again, did we ever think otherwise?

[This article][3] (thanks to [Paul][4] for the URL) documents yet another list of examples showing how the US is able to use its dollars to garner support for its war plans.

It&#8217;s a very silly kind of democracy.
