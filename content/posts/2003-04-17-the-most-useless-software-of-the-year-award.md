As we all are aware of the frighteningly high editorial standards of [freshmeat.net][1] (ha ha), I have to wonder how [MumabAs][2] was accepted.

This MULTI-FUNCTION software is a GUI (graphical user interface) for, wait for it, &#8220;configuring which mailboxes mutt should watch for new mail&#8221;. Aaaaarrrggggghhhhh!!!

For those of you who don&#8217;t know, [mutt][3] is a MUA (mail user agent) with a text-based UI. Usually, &#8220;configuring which mailboxes mutt should watch for new mail&#8221; is a question of editing one (1) line in the config file. So, following this guy&#8217;s example, we&#8217;d have a different GUI program (each with its own freshmeat entry) for configuring each line in the mutt configuration file.

I really don&#8217;t care if someone wants to entertain himself by writing these useless pieces of software, but perhaps publishing it on freshmeat.net was not entirely appropriate.
