My dual 933MHz PIII that was state of the art three years ago has now become quite long in the tooth. Fortunately, [Ari][1] has graciously allowed me to use his old workstation (since he&#8217;ll probably be spending significantly more time with his new employer). This &#8220;hand-me-down&#8221; :) has a 2.4GHz P4, 512MB DDR (soon to be upgraded), lotsa disc space, a GeForce4 4600 with 128MB ram of its own and a _beautiful_ 18&#8243; Dell UltraSharp LCD screen. Subjectively, everything just flies!

Fank you Ari&#8230; \*sniff\*
