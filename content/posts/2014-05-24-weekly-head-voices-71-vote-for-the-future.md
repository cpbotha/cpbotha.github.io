On Wednesday May 7, together with just over 18 million other South Africans, I voted. Afterwards, my thumb looked like this:
{{< figure src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/voting_thumb.jpg" link="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/voting_thumb.jpg" caption="POWER THUMB!">}} 

… and the rest of me felt **like a million bucks**!

Some complained about the outcome. I think we’re moving, albeit slowly, in the direction of a healthy democracy. Here are [this year’s results][1], and here are [2009’s results][2]. The opposition has been growing (slowly) at a national level. Interestingly, in Gauteng, smallest province with all of the money and power, the opposition is making similar progress.

Late to the party as per usual, I discovered [Vagrant][3], a fantastic command-line tool to create, use and destroy virtual machines AT A WHIM. I was so happy with this that I created <a data-rel="lightbox-video-0" href="http://youtu.be/sY0wNgTpEOg" title="vagrant screencast">this screencast</a>, which has the added advantage of being an effective component of insomnia treatment. (Yes, I do know about and have even played with Docker. For what I’m doing now (deploying multiple self-contained servers on on-premises servers without direct access), vagrant+virtualbox fits better.)

On the topic of nerdy software, let’s turn the dial to 11. I’ve started using emacs 24 with [mu4e][4] as my main email client now. It looks like this:
{{< figure src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/cpbotha-mu4e-screenie.png" link="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/cpbotha-mu4e-screenie.png" caption="mu4e screenshot with nvpy search active">}} 

After leaving GMail, I made do for a while with Thunderbird, but wasn’t really happy with it. (It’s really an awesome email client, but my inner nerd wanted more.) I can honestly say that I’m in email heaven at the moment. My 68 thousand email archive is locally mirrored with [offlineimap 0.6.5][5]. mu4e in Emacs is able to perform search requests through the whole archive in milliseconds. It makes GMail seem positively snail-like in comparison. In addition, I can use my crappy elisp-fu to make it do the most silly things with the user interface and my email. Oh yes, and [zenburn][6]. Gaaaaaaaaaaah…

Completely accidentally, I saw Star Trek Into Darkness on Netflix the other night (no, we don’t have Netflix over here, really) and was completely BLOWN AWAY. Benedict Cumberbatch as Khan was an awe-inspiring movie villain. According to [the Wikipedia page on Khan Noonien Singh][7] (recurring villain in the Star Trek universe), Jonathan Romney of The Independent had the following to say about Cumberbatch’s voice:

> [It was] so sepulchrally resonant that it could have been synthesised from the combined timbres of Ian McKellen, Patrick Stewart and Alan Rickman holding an elocution contest down a well.

Dang. If you’ve seen the movie, you’ll know what he’s talking about.

Just in case you thought that we didn’t live in the future, have a look at this live video stream of the Earth, taken by the cameras of the International Space Station, which is only floating 422km above the Earth’s surface:
