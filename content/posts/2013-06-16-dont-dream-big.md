For months I&#8217;ve been walking around with this idea in my head. I was planning to turn it into a blog post titled &#8220;On not scaling&#8221;. It was going to be about deliberately choosing focus over bandwidth in one&#8217;s activities. One is often faced with the choice between scaling up (more work, more people, more things, more turnover, more for the sake of more) on the one hand, and simply not scaling on the other, instead holding on to one&#8217;s simple and linear way of doing a few things well. The former approach seems to be the one favoured and encouraged by modern society. The latter has become my preference.

I was still planning to write this post, when I ran into a TEDX talk by Jim Zemlin, whose claim to fame (at least for the purpose of his talk), is that he is technically Linus Torvalds&#8217; boss. Linus Torvalds is the gentleman who created Linux. As you might or might not know, Linux is taking over the world at the moment: 1.3 million new telephones running Android (Linux) are switched on for the first time every day, 0.7 million new Linux-running TVs are sold every day, millions of machines at Google and Amazon run Linux, machines which run most of the web-based services that you know, almost the whole internet runs Linux, and many more embedded systems everywhere. Whether you like it or not, and as Jim Zemlin says, you probably interact with Linux multiple times per day in some way or another.

Through his World-changing creation Linux (and don&#8217;t forget the distributed version control system git), Linus arguably is one of the most concretely influential people alive today. With this in mind, skip to about 5:20 in the youtube clip (if you don&#8217;t have time, you don&#8217;t actually have to watch the clip, my summary of the relevant bit is right below):

<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper">

When Linus first [announced][1] Linux 1991, he wrote _I&#8217;m doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won&#8217;t be big and professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones_. With hindsight, this is a fabulously humble quote. Linus was only interested in the awesome thingamabob he was working on; success and ambition were irrelevant. In the end, his creation changed the world.

From this, Zemlin draws a parallel with something the poet Robert Frost [said][2]:

> Don&#8217;t aim for success if you want it; just do what you love and believe in, and it will come naturally.

I think this is a beautiful life lesson.

Let&#8217;s not dream too big.
