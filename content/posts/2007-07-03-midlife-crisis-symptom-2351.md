I&#8217;m going to keep this post short and sweet by making use of a visual aid:

<a href="http://cpbotha.webfactional.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/pukkelpop_anon.jpg" title="" data-rel="lightbox-image-0" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="">![pukkelpop_anon.jpg][1]</a>

The line-up includes Tool, Smashing Pumpkins, Nine Inch Nails (I&#8217;m going there for Trent), Sonic Youth, Lacuna Coil, Iggy Pop and some pimply new kids on the block, such as Kaiser Chiefs and Fall Out Boy.

Now I just have to decide whether I&#8217;m going to grow that festival moustache or not&#8230;
