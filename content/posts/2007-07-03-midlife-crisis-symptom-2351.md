I’m going to keep this post short and sweet by making use of a visual aid:

<a data-rel="lightbox-image-0" data-rl_caption="" data-rl_title="" href="/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/pukkelpop_anon.jpg" title="">![pukkelpop_anon.jpg][1]</a>

The line-up includes Tool, Smashing Pumpkins, Nine Inch Nails (I’m going there for Trent), Sonic Youth, Lacuna Coil, Iggy Pop and some pimply new kids on the block, such as Kaiser Chiefs and Fall Out Boy.

Now I just have to decide whether I’m going to grow that festival moustache or not…
