The week has resulted in a terribly nerdy list of bullets. READ AT YOUR OWN RISK! (there&#8217;s a beer recommendation or three at the end to compensate) 

<ul class="org-ul">
  <li>
    It turns out that the terrible Samsung trim bug which would eat all of your data, <a href="https://blog.algolia.com/when-solid-state-drives-are-not-that-solid/">as discovered by Algolia</a>, was <a href="http://www.spinics.net/lists/raid/msg49468.html">a Linux kernel bug after all</a> (now patched by Samsung) and that it would only affect RAID setups. Let&#8217;s hope there are no surprising new turning outs.
  </li>
  <li>
    Found out that the fastest ADSL lines available at my new place are a whole 2 Mbit/s. We&#8217;ve called off the transaction and we&#8217;re now searching for a new house.
  </li>
  <li>
    I&#8217;m joking. It <b>was</b> really shocking however to consider the world as seen through a 2 Mbit/s connection. Now it seems that I will soon be entering the wonderful world of 5 GHz wireless connectivity, which should give me a fast enough connection, at least until fibre is rolled out in the year 3047.
  </li>
  <li>
    Started watching <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4158110/">Mr Robot</a>. I don&#8217;t normally do series, but the pilot was just <i>that</i> good. I like the story, I really like the socially very strangely adjusted hacker protagonist and I love the cinematography. Up to episode 3, I give it 4 out of 5 Linux Distributions!
  </li>
  <li>
    Continued fighting with OSX to get it completely working with my Dvorak and Emacs keybindings, also in Java apps such as IntelliJ IDEA. <a href="http://cpbotha.net/2015/07/19/weekly-head-voices-94-into-the-wild/">Two weeks ago I mentioned karabiner</a> as a solution to most of these problems. The final piece of the puzzle was unbinding keys like <code>Alt+W</code> (or <code>Mod+W</code> as Apple calls it) in <code>~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict</code> to prevent OSX from turning it into a \(\Sigma\) (sigma); as everyone knows, <code>M-w</code> is the Emacs shortcut for copying the selected region! You can use this trick to prevent OSX from turning any of the other <code>Mod</code> combos into completely unwanted special characters. (My base dict file is <a href="http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~jrus/Site/cocoa-text.html">that of Jacob Rus</a>.)
  </li>
  <li>
    I guess OSX only Just Works(tm) if your time is worth nothing. Err&#x2026;
  </li>
  <li>
    My <a href="https://github.com/kivy/kivy/pull/3506">first Kivy pull request</a>, a fix for a Mac-bug (go figure), was recently merged into <a href="http://kivy.org/">master</a>. I&#8217;ve been using Kivy in the third or fourth generation of my current and probably longest running side project.
  </li>
  <li>
    I&#8217;ve also been screencasting some of my night-time coding sessions using one of the more prominent livecoding sites (bonus points if you can find these sleep-inducing performances). It has been an interesting and strange experience programming with people watching over one&#8217;s shoulder as it were.
  </li>
  <li>
    On Sunday, I ended up at the <a href="http://www.root44.co.za/index.php">Root44 Market</a> in Stellenbosch for another of those really terrible balmy winter days. I had so much fun in the sun, tasting <a href="http://www.devilspeakbrewing.co.za/first-light-golden-ale/">Devil&#8217;s Peak First Light Golden Ale</a> and their <a href="http://www.devilspeakbrewing.co.za/kings-blockhouse-ipa/">King&#8217;s Blockhouse IPA</a>, and <a href="http://stellenbrau.co.za/beers/">Stellenbrau&#8217;s Craven Lager</a>, all from the tap, that I forgot to take a photo of the beautiful surroundings.
  </li>
</ul>

Have a beautiful week dear readers! Just remember, _I&#8217;m never gonna give you up._
