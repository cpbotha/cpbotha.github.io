Congratulations, you have successfully completed the week of Monday February 8 to Sunday February 14, 2016!

About 4 seconds after posting previous edition [WHV #104][1] to Facebook with the &#8220;When you&#8217;re a vegan <boy with bulging veins> and haven&#8217;t told anyone in 10 minutes&#8221; meme image included, friend Ivo T. zinged me with this reply:

So much truth. I have been put back in my place. Sorry vegans. Sorry MBA students. Not sorry Ayn Randers.

This is currently my favourite lager ever (at least until next week):

It is indeed a craft beer. If we&#8217;ve ever chatted more than 10 minutes in the past (or in the future), you&#8217;ll know everything about my braai, and you probably also know that I find craft beer to be one of the greatest inventions ever, along with fire, and the internet.

Here&#8217;s a another beer which I recently had the pleasure of enjoying, at a secret networking meeting (yes, we have secret meetings where we in fact do manage a large number of aspects of your daily life, and where we also orchestrate it so you&#8217;ll never suspect that we are behind everything, subtly manipulating reality) where, when the beer arrived at the table, everyone who looked vaguely hipster-like claimed vocally not in fact to be even remotely hipster-like:

META-HIPSTER CRAFT BEER! At first I was confused, but then I realised it was just another case of **WHAT A TIME TO BE ALIVE!**

(By the way, I stripped the EXIF GPS data from the Jack Black photo, because privacy, but I left it hidden in the tears of the hipster. First one who tells me in the comments where the secret meeting was held gets a free craft beer!)

_Nerd tip of the week_: It&#8217;s somehow not prominent enough on their site, but GitLab, the open source GitHub alternative, also [offer free hosting of an unlimited number of private repositories with an unlimited number of private collaborators][2]. In other words, if you&#8217;re on a budget, you can host your commercial and proprietary project git repositories (and bug tracking and wikis) there at _no cost_. This is cheaper than github ($7 for the smallest subscription for 5 private repos) and better than bitbucket (private repos for free, but if you have more than 5 team members you have to pay). I pay quite gladly for the online services I use, but in this particular case, such a level of free is hard not to like.

_Nerd tip #2 of the week:_ The [Clang static C++ analyser][3] is brilliant. If you program in C++, and you need to up your game, integrating this into your workflow is a solid step in the right direction. I&#8217;ve been using this via the [scan-build method][4]. Let me know in the comments if you&#8217;d like to know more about this!

After some [professional][5] ethernet cabling down to the sort-of basement of our new house, I have checked off another item from my non-existent bucket list: _We now have a lab at our house._ So far there are computers, all kinds of DIY supplies and art stuff for the genetic offspring units, and all of this to _create_. I spent some of the best times of my life in labs of some sort of another. It&#8217;s really great bringing some of that back home to my clan.

Have a great week kids, see you on the other side!
