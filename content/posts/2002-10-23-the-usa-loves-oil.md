This is brilliant: &#8220;I helped blow up a Bali nightclub &#8212; by driving my SUV to work every day!&#8221; Thanks for the link, [Rudolph][1].

Read the whole article [here][2]. Keep in mind that the USA is responsible for a **quarter** (25%) of the **world&#8217;s TOTAL oil usage**. This and other interesting tidbits such as the fact that the USA also burns 25% of the world&#8217;s TOTAL coal are available [here][3].
