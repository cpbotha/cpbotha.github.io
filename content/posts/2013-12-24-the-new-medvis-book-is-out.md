For the past 2.5 years, I have been helping my friend [Prof. Bernhard Preim][1] to write the new Medical Visualization textbook. A crazy number of hours of studying scientific literature (a quick count in the bbl file yields 1880 cited references!!), trying to fit everything into a coherent conceptual framework and then trying to write all of it down as a more or less readable story has finally led to more than 1000 pages of Medical Visualization reading pleasure.

It looks like this:

[<img class="alignnone" alt="" src="http://medvisbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/cover_full_20130729.jpg" width="1650" height="922" />][2]

The title has been changed to _Visual Computing for Medicine_ to reflect the significant rework, and also the broader treatment of the field.Â The book itself is 836 pages with hundreds of colour figures. Five chapters (190+ pages) are [available exclusively online][3], free to download.

Go to [the book website][4] (run by us) to read more [about the contents][5] of the book, and to find out [where you can get your very own copy][6]!

P.S. It was a huge pleasure working on the book together with Bernhard. (We&#8217;ve been collaborating quite intensively since the end of 2007 somewhere, when we started setting up the [Eurographics Workshops on Visual Computing for Biology and Medicine][7], which have since then been held in 2008, 2010, 2012 and will be held again in 2014 in Vienna.) Just for the record, he definitely put a great deal more work into the book than I did. The exact ratio will remain our secret.
