My webhoster secretly disabled catch-all email addresses for email. Coincidentally, this is how I was forwarding everything to my gmail account, which means that all mail to my domain bounced for at least a few days. If you left a comment on this blog, or somehow have the feeling that Iâ€™m ignoring you, please resend your mail.
