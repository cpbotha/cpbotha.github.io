-   Woke up to gorgeous day in Betty's Bay, spent first half on the beach
-   Spent second half of the day slowly packing up all of our stuff (not my favourite vacation phase), some drinks, and working in-between on stuffing the archaic [wlziipsrv.fcgi](https://github.com/ma-tech/WlzIIPSrv) into a debian bookworm aarch64 image. Mostly bunches of ugly new hacks to work around some of the ugly old hacks in wlziipsrv.
-   Scenic Clarence Drive route home, stopped at [Café Zest in Gordon's Bay](https://zestdining.co.za/) for dinner. Yellowtail there was absolutely amazing! (thanks to GOU#1 who picked this jewel of a restaurant and made a reservation for us, all from the car)
-   At home, finally got wlziipsrv built. Am secretly hopeful it might even work. (need to hook it up to supervisord, then nginx, then all of the microscopy data)
