## Monday 2024-02-19 to Wednesday 2024-02-21 {#monday-2024-02-19-to-wednesday-2024-02-21}

-   Prepared for and did business trip to Johannesburg with longest time friend FS.
    -   Highlight was tripping with FS, and trip was successful to boot.
    -   Only one night away, really missed the famjam.
-   Dealing with stomach issues this week, relatively mild but distracting nonetheless.


## Thursday 2024-02-22 {#thursday-2024-02-22}

-   Short run this morning in school district. Not feeling 100%, but good enough for run and conditions perfect.
    -   Did run into G-J on Reservoir road and had quick chat, serendipity! Lunch will follow.
-   Stomach getting better, but not yet in a good place.


## Friday 2024-02-23 {#friday-2024-02-23}

-   Ran into the [Kagi sidekick](https://sidekick.kagi.com/) proposal, which made me think about frontend-only search functions for my static websites
    -   [SemanticFinder](https://github.com/do-me/SemanticFinder): Frontend-only live semantic search with transformers.js
    -   [victoria.dev: Adding lunr.js to Hugo for frontend-only search](https://victoria.dev/blog/add-search-to-hugo-static-sites-with-lunr/)
-   Spent some cycles today exploring ways to save a tweet so that it can be archived and searched offline
    -   If I could just traverse the DOM tree, starting from the `<article>` or the parent `<section>`, and also gathering all of the applicable styles, I would be golden
        -   Discovered three different paid-for chrome extensions that do exactly this. Small side-hustle idea right there.
    -   [MarkDownload extension](https://github.com/deathau/markdownload) for saving any page as markdown came quite close
    -   Dev tools "capture node screenshot" saves to PNG. Would have been great if it could have done the same to PDF.
-   Had a lovely lunch with great colleague from 1999/2000 at Mont Marie in Stellenbosch.
    -   Randomly reached out when I heard that he was back in this valley, super grateful for this enjoyable reconnection.
    -   Remember, [call up your friends!](/2022/09/25/weekly-head-voices-246-call-up-your-friends/#call-up-your-friends)


## Saturday 2024-02-24 {#saturday-2024-02-24}

-   Spent too many hours building a Tampermonkey script with which I can get tweet threads reasonably clean in order to print  them
    -   First time using Tampermonkey, good tool to have on the belt!
    -   Twitter makes this a lot more tricky than it needs to be.
    -   Ideally, people would stop using twitter altogether, but for the ML crowd, I still need to go there
-   Perfect dinner at Decameron in Stellenbosch with the family, because we had to take GOU#1 to a party in the region
-   Karpathy proclaims his love for Obsidian, very cool! <https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1761467904737067456>


## Sunday 2024-02-25 {#sunday-2024-02-25}

-   Thanks to serendipitous serendipity the previous day, took part in an unexpected and epic hike up India Venster with a lifetime friend (first hike together in the 90s!) and a fantastic new friend. Experienced maximal presence. Glorious.
