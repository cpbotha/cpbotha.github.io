-   Typing this note in the fresh new `2024-01-Jan.org` file, in the completely fresh new `journals/2024/` directory.
-   Had to fetch GOU#1 from her NYE party in Hermanus, where they had been focusing more on the party parts and less on the sleeping parts.
-   On the way back, stopped at my aunt and uncle in Onrust to give best wishes for the new year in person. Slipped and talked about AI a bit. Oops.
-   Back home, read to GOU#3 (now 7) what I wrote about her in this blog when she was born, and at various points since then. Seeing her reaction makes this activity even more worth it. (pro-tip: Tag post with the GOU in question!)
-   Read about the evolution of aging, the mutation accumulation (MA) and the antagonistic pleiotropy (AP) hypotheses in <https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/the-evolution-of-aging-23651151/> during the preparation of my [traditional year transition blog post](/tags/transition/). Not depressing at all!
-   Reclining on sofa, back almost horizontal, with laptop on lap, is an underrated ergonomic lifehack.
