-   Researching assault-style airbikes as an alternative cardio modality, for when I would like a workout that's not running (for when my joints need some rest) and that's not in the sun so much
    -   An assault-style airbike uses a big fan as the front wheel, and engages your arms and upper body as well. Seems to be an important staple in the crossfit world. I'm not sure if I'm the right person for it, but it sure looks convincing!
    -   Here's a not-too-crazy beginner cardio workout example on youtube: <https://youtu.be/6OMfabFyVFI?si=SId44AGsPX9U2YZJ>
-   Really special braai with a group of besties, hosted by SnR. According to the highly scientific DHV-scale, the evening has been classified as "life-affirming" and also "the absolute best possible way to spend those hours". So much thank you!
