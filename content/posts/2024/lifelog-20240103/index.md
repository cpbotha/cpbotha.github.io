-   [Tom Scott, and the formidable power of escalating streaks](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jan/2/escalating-streaks/) a post by Simon Willison, who himself is now stranger to the formidable power of streaks... (hint: blog post monster)
-   Went for easy run late afternoon. Run was super enjoyable. Hip niggle only made its appearance at around 5.5km and was manageable.
-   Dinner with family in Betty's Bay.
-   During the day and after dinner spent some hours working on the year transition post, which is one of the reasons for this bullet list being shorter than yesterday.
