I don&#8217;t have the time to explain to you how much [SORBS][1] sucks and how I wish that their servers and their whole organisation would just disappear from the face of the internet, so I&#8217;ll point you at some other reports:

  * [Why SORBS Sucks][2]
  * [SORBS Sucks][3]
  * [Why I agree that SORBS sucks!][4]
  * [Google results for &#8220;sorbs sucks&#8221;][5]

One of the GMail MTAs (qmail.gmail.com) has been listed in the SORBS database (due to one jackass sending a mail to a SORBS spamtrap address) and now I haven&#8217;t been able to send mail to a number of my friends and family. Many GMail users will be terribly inconvenienced by this. If I want to have the IP delisted, I&#8217;m supposed to pay SORBS $50. That&#8217;s extortion!

I&#8217;ve reported this to Google, I hope that they are able to sort this out quickly. Experience teaches that SORBS is not very responsive though. That&#8217;s yet another reason to boycott them.

If you are an ISP or some other SORBS-using instantiation, consider giving them the boot and using a more responsible service like the [Spamhaus DNSBL][6].
