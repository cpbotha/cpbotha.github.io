Dear readers,

I would like to introduce you to my new friend:<figure id="attachment_1106" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1106" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://cpbotha.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/leifheit_macro.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-image-0" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title="">

It is old-fashioned and mechanical. It makes an extremely comforting ticking sound, and then after the 25 minutes of [focus-time][1] are over, starts ringing. The ticking is not too loud, and not too soft. The ringing is just the right length. You don&#8217;t take my word for it, as I&#8217;ve made you a short movie clip:

<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper">
  <span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='840' height='473' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/BEIwkUOWF9U?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span>
</div>

Comforting, no?

In spite of a number of deadlines having been successfully met, I&#8217;m still in the lamentable situation where every second counts, so I&#8217;m going back to bullet mode for the rest of this post:

  * The [FNSF][2] and I managed to finish that Indecent Research Proposal and submit it at 11:57 on Wedensday, 3 minutes before the Deadline for Indecent Proposals at the Dutch Science Foundation ([NWO][3]). We almost missed the deadline due to the extremely primitive web-submission system in use there. If you happen to be invited to review this proposal, please approve it. You Can Trust Us. :)
  * The real-time collaboration functionality in the new Google Docs was a life-saver during the writing of this proposal. Being able to see FNSF&#8217;s cursor move and edits happen in real-time was really great for coordinating. Now if they could only improve: 1)Â The styling possibilities (there are none at the moment, so you have to manually change typesetting if you don&#8217;t agree with their default style) and 2) The PDF export (it inserted page-breaks within tables and generally screwed up. Eventually I exported to MS Word, fixed typesetting and page-breaks there, then exported to PDF); then I would be happy.
  * On Friday I had one of the most hectic oral defences of my life. There&#8217;s a high probability I&#8217;ll have to try again in a year or two&#8217;s time. Or never. I&#8217;ll keep you posted. Or not.
  * Partly due to the events of Friday, but also to continuous general self-reflection (read: voices in my head that never sleep), I will gradually revise my publication strategy in the coming years. Bottom-line: I have to focus more on generalising until our applications start looking like pure theory. :)
  * I&#8217;m slowly learning how to say _no_. It&#8217;s hard, but at least there is some professional help available:

In a few weeks, I hope to have the time to write you a _proper_ post. Until that glorious occasion, I&#8217;ll do my best to keep you up to date with these healthy and low-fat WHV light editions!
