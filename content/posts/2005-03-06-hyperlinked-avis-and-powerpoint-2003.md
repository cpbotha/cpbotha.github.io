In my new life as PowerPoint 2003 flunky, I experience many and exciting adventures! My latest adventure involved hyperlinking AVI movies (encoded with the MS-MPEG4 codec) to images in a PowerPoint presentation. Clicking on the hyperlinks would result in a &#8220;Media Player&#8221; dialog box popping up with the helpful message &#8220;There is no driver installed on your system&#8221;. After clicking OK, the movie would play perfectly in spite of the awful implications of having no driver installed on my system.

You probably can&#8217;t guess what the solution was.

It turns out that renaming the linked AVI file to have an .MPG extension (and re-doing the hyperlink accordingly) makes this problem go away. I believe this is what&#8217;s called &#8220;Redmond Logic(tm)&#8221;. :)
