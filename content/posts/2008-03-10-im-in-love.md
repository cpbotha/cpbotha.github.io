... with Vienna.

As mentioned [elsewhere][1], I'm in Vienna at the moment for ECR 2008. Tonight
started with a heavenly dinner at the [Vital Images][2] party in the [Sky
Bar][3]. By 22:00, my night was already more or less perfect, mostly due to
great company and beautiful food. However, we (an intrepid group of Medical
Delta scientists from Delft, Rotterdam and Leiden) decided to go to [Der Roter
Engel][4] in the Bermuda Triangle, mostly because I insisted that the night
would only be complete after some cocktails. Their Long Island Tea was
delectable. All of them, as a matter of fact.

In any case, of course I missed the last underground from Schottenring to
Schottentor, so I was more or less forced to go for a stroll all the way to
Kochgasse in Der Josefstadt, where [my apartment][5] is situated, which, by
the way, I very strongly recommend to anyone visiting this beautiful
city. This wonderful stroll at 1 in the morning simply confirmed my already
positive feeling with regards to Vienna: this is a fantastically beautiful
city and it has a very mysterious although exceptionally pleasant vibe. I will
now have to start plotting nefarious plans in order to be able to come back in
the near future and spend a significant amount of time getting to know her
better.
