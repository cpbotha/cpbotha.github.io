I am against the use of firearms and also against the right of any civilian to own and use such a thing. However, there are more than enough people who aren&#8217;t and who&#8217;re willing to fight for this right.

In that case, maybe a compromise is in order, such as
  
[this smart gun][1] which is only able to fire if its registered owner is operating it and also records (as far as possible) the circumstances at the time of use. If the design is robust, this should make the abuse of firearms much more difficult.
