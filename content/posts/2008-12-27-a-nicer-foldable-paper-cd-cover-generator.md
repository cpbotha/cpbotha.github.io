Here&#8217;s my nerdy DIY tool and tip for the day: With a single sheet of A4 (or letter) paper, you can fold a sleeve for any CD or DVD.  This is ideal for those CDs lying around where they shouldn&#8217;t, and also for gifts of pirated software and music (harr harr).

I&#8217;ve made a web-app (CGI) that will generate a PDF with folding lines and labeling text, including titles, descriptions and track listings, that you can print out and fold to protect your most beloved optical media in a unique yet stylish fashion.  Click [here to go to the webapp][1], please come back to this posting to leave a comment!

  * **Update:** see the new [folding guide][2]!
  * **Update:** thanks to a suggestion by [Stefan van der Walt][3], the CGI now suggests a filename based on your title.
