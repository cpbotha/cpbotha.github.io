It seems that the [Redjeki Toko][1] in Delft (click [here][2] for my Google Map that&#8217;ll lead you right there) also sells miso soup! I acquired a supply of my [old favourite][3], but also decided to try a different type of miso, just for kicks:

It&#8217;s a so-called _family pack_, I prefer to call it The Addict&#8217;s Friend. There are eight (8) servings in there, man! Notice the big &#8216;8&#8217; on the package promoting this fact. There is also 30% more or less of something else in there, but I&#8217;ll probably never know exactly what.

In any case, this miso is nice, and has more floating thingies in there, but somehow not as nice as [the other stuff][5]. (Yes, I know, I should work on my miso terminology.)
