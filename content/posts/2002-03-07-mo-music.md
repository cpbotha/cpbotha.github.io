It would have been terribly useful if emusic.com had some facility for discussing the available music. I&#8217;ve discovered some jewels there (My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult for example) but I&#8217;ve had to work through quite an amount of audio. Hey, maybe I should mail them!

I&#8217;m adding the final touches to the camera-ready version of my IEEE VisSym 2002 article. This has to be done by tomorrow, and then the fun can begin with some messy TF domain image processing.
