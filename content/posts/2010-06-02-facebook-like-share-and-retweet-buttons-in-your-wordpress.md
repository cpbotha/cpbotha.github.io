Hey man, I&#8217;m really busy at the moment, but it took me unnecessarily long to get those really hip facebook like, facebook share and retweet buttons everywhere on my blog, so I thought I&#8217;d try and save you some time by dropping a quick note on how I did it.

Adding the Facebook Like button functionality wasted the most time, because there are far too many plugins and howtos that claim to work and don&#8217;t quite. I ended up using the Like plugin ([official wordpress page][1] and [plugin website][2]), because it has the best documentation that includes details on [all the ways in which things can go wrong][3], and there are many.  I&#8217;m using the IFRAME option, also because that seems to work most of the time.  I had a hard time finding this plugin in the built-in directory, so I downloaded and installed it manually.

For the facebook share button, I use the [_Facebook Share (New) Button_ plugin][4], and for the retweet button, I&#8217;m using the [_Topsy Retweet Button_ plugin][5].  I installed both of them from the built-in &#8220;Plugins | Add New&#8221; directory.

In all three cases, I made use of the plugin options to have the buttons placed all over my blog, instead of manually editing the theme.

I hope that you enjoy your shiny buttons, and I look forward to seeing you for the next [Weekly Head Voices][6]!
