When editing Python text, I usually use emacs on Linux and XEmacs on Windows. However, I would _love_ a cross-platform Python development environment in the style of Visual Slickedit or similar. It should have code-completion (for the **umpteenth** time, dabbrev in emacs is NOT code-completion!), it should show calltips (incorporating the relevant docstrings) when I&#8217;m instantiating objects or calling functions and it should have some kind of graphical object browser. It&#8217;s syntax highlighting and auto-indentation should be _at least_ as good as that of emacs. Emacs has caught numerous programming errors before they even happened due to its auto-indentation.

PythonWin on Windows is not a bad example. However, it&#8217;s keybindings are not configurable. I&#8217;m still holding out for something which allows me to use emacs keybindings or similar. Moving my hand all the way to the &#8220;Home&#8221;, &#8220;End&#8221; and arrow keys really interferes with my typing. In addition, it&#8217;s auto-indentation is not as rigid as that of emacs and, of course, it only runs on Windows.

I&#8217;ve searched far and wide for such a tool, but I always seem to end up back in the arms of emacs. I&#8217;ve also been having evil dreams about hacking real auto-completion and calltips and whatnot into emacs using [pymacs][1], but that will have to happen at some later stage.

If you&#8217;re a kickass programmer lying around wondering what open-source wonder to bring us next, please think about making The Kickass Python IDE.

Of course I could just shell out hard-earned cash and buy [WingIDE][2] and get it over with. That would unfortunately also mean that I&#8217;d have to pay double for at least a Windows and Linux license. If you&#8217;re still wondering whether you should buy me my [dream laptop][3], maybe you could bundle WindIDE with it?

Thanks!
