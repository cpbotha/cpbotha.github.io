According to the UN HDR of 2004, the top five most developed countries in the world are: Norway, Sweden, Australia, Canada and the Netherlands (whoohoo!). Things have not changed much since the HDR of last year. South Africa is at position 119 (just above the UK &#8211; just joking!) and is classified as having &#8220;medium human development&#8221;.

The HDR is based on various factors, including literacy, education, average life expectancy, per capita GDP, etc. and makes for interesting reading. You can start [here][1].
