_**For my regular readers:** This post has an extremely high gadget-nerd index. To read it, you either have to be a nerd, or just love gadgets. **For the rest of you:** This review differs from other HTC Desire Z reviews because I&#8217;ve actually been using this phone as my only smartphone quite intensively, and because I&#8217;m writing up, in great depth, my iopinion as a gadget-toting ex-Linux-zealot computer science nerd. Take that engadget!_

As many of you know, I was completely in love with my previous smartphone. Not surprising, seeing as the Nokia e71 is perfect, at least hardware-wise. However, partly due to Symbian (Nokia&#8217;s operating system) really dragging its heels (Nokia, does your mobile OS really have to feel like it teleported in from 1970?) and partly due to Android (Google&#8217;s mobile operating system) doing the exact opposite, I&#8217;d been not-so-patiently waiting for the right Android-running telephone to come along so I could start drinking the Google Kool-Aid.

Enter the HTC Desire Z, known in the US as the T-Mobile G2, a micro-laptop with built-in mobile phone, or a flashlight with built-in laptop and phoning function, whichever you prefer:<figure id="attachment_1170" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1170" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://cpbotha.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/htc_desirez_examples.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-image-0" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title="">
