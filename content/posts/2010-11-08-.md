**NOTE:** _This is a draft post that was never completed or published. In 2021-09-12, as I was preparing to be able to push everything to github, I decided to push this INCOMPLETE DRAFT out as well._

From Sunday October 24 to Friday October 29, I found my extremely fortunate self in Salt Lake City, Utah, US and A, attending IEEE VisWeek 2010, the biggest and one of the best (the other being EuroVis, of course) visualisation conferences today. This **short** blog post is, as always, my extremely biased view on the whole event.

VisWeek, or just Vis, as it’s called by its regulars, besides a being forum for the dissemination of the best visualisation research, is quite a social event. Every coffee break, lunch, dinner and post-dinner beer-or-other-beverage-consumption-opportunity was happily shared with colleagues and friends, with sleep taking a distant 7th position in the rankings. My [EuroVis 2010 post][1] contains a short summary on what _really_ happens during scientific conferences, if you’re interested.

In any case, I got to present [ERCI’s][2] paper _Integrated Visual Analysis for Heterogeneous Datasets in Cohort Studies_ at the [Visual Analytics in Health Care workshop][3] (go to the program page to check and download any of the accepted papers) on Sunday. I just _love_ presenting stuff. Of the 5 people present (I exaggerate of course, there were 7) (I still exaggerate of course, there were more), at least two gave positive feedback afterwards, so I assume it didn’t go too badly. [The BJECT][2] presented his paper _[Articulated Planar Reformation for Change Visualization in Small Animal Imaging][4]_ during the _main_ Vis programme on Thursday. Many compliments were received for the work, along with some constructive advice that will surely come in handy when the BJECT gets to present at VisWeek 2011, okay?! :)

My favourite presentations of the conference were the following: _NEVER TO BE COMPLETED_
