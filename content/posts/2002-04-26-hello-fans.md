Too many beers last night&#8230;. ugh. Fortunately there&#8217;s [soma fm][1] for some soothing streaming music. I just can&#8217;t seem to decide between the Groove Salad and the Secret Agent (&#8220;The soundtrack for your stylish, mysterious, dangerous life&#8221;) streams, although my mysterious life does make me biased towards the latter.

Soothing music + not moving too often or too suddenly == productivity. I think.
