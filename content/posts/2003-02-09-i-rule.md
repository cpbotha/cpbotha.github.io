After a few minutes of Perl \*ptooooey\* hacking, I&#8217;ve re-elevated myself back to the super-user that I am. I now have authoring permissions over all blogs on this system and won&#8217;t be able to lose them again.

If you&#8217;ve somehow lost authoring permissions on blogs in a Movable Type installation that you maintain, download and run [this script][1]. It will only work if you had permissions before and subsequently lost them. It won&#8217;t create these permissions from scratch. It&#8217;s left as an exercise for the reader to implement this last bit.
