For the next three days I&#8217;ll be in a green place far far away&#8230; okay maybe it&#8217;s not so far away, but it is very green. I&#8217;m going to the annual conference of the Dutch Advanced School for Computing and Imaging which should be quite interesting. On Thursday (the second day of the conference) we will be going to Marjolein&#8217;s wedding reception!! Wheeee!

Monday is another holiday, which is good. It means this weekend will be a long weekend, which is **always** appreciated.
