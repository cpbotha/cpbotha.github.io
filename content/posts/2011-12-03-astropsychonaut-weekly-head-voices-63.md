I recently came across this hauntingly beatiful time-lapse view of Earth made from the ISS (the International Space Station! Yes, we have one!):

Watching this, my nostalgia flared up. You see, I&#8217;ve been addicted to science fiction ever since I can remember. It started with Buck Rogers, and the original Star Trek, and only got much worse when I discovered Arthur C. Clarke, Ray Bradbury, Isaac Asimov and Douglas Hill. I find Kubrick&#8217;s 2001 and even the sequel movie 2010 beautiful.

For the longest time, I wanted to be an astronaut. I think I still do.

I believe I might have thought that my career plans would be seen as childish when I wrote this short piece for school detailing my life plans when I was 7 or 8 (late eighties, not saying anymore):<figure id="attachment_1577" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1577" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://cpbotha.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/cpbotha_life_plans.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-image-0" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title="">

My brother found this somewhere and put it on facebook. I wonder what it would be like to go back in time and explain that concept to myself.</figcaption></figure> 

For those of you without the required Afrikaans background, here is a short translation, as true as possible to the original:

> When I gow up, I&#8217;d like to work with computers, because then I&#8217;ll become really smart and I&#8217;ll know more about the outdoors and nature. As I grow older, I&#8217;ll become a professor, because perhaps I&#8217;ll find a cure for leprosy and after that I&#8217;m going to study to be a millionaire, because then I&#8217;ll go abroad or around the world.

Not a bad plan for a 7 or 8 year old, if you don&#8217;t mind me saying so myself. This note has in fact reminded me that there&#8217;s still more than enough decisions to be made and work to do, so I&#8217;ll have to postpone becoming an astronaut for a little while longer. At least by the end I&#8217;m going to end up a rich traveller, which is probably not a bad deal.

In other news this week:

  * It seems like just the other day that I made my [400th connection on LinkedIn][1]. I&#8217;m happy to report that I broke the 500 barrier two weeks ago, and now I have that fancy looking &#8220;500+&#8221; next to my name. I finetuned my headline to celebrate the occasion, after which I promptly got approached by a head hunter.
  * Jonathan Dyer is the guru of facial hair. Check out [all the beard types and accompanying facial expressions][2] that he has mastered. Yes, that&#8217;s a hint of jealousy that you detect in my writing.
  * More reasons to love the coffee: Giving rats the equivalent of what a human gets after two cups of coffee, the caffeine caused nerve cells in a certain region of the hippocampus to show a significantly bigger burst of activity. These strengthened synapses might have a role in learning and memory. Read [this summary on boingboing][3] and [the article on Nature Neuroscience][4].
  * In an exceptionally disappointing move, [South African parliament has passed a new secrecy bill][5] that gives members of government the power to declare information a state secret, thus deterring honest-keeping journalists and other whistle-blowers with a 25 year jail sentence. Desmond Tutu sums it up nicely when he says that this makes the State answerable only to the State.

    <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 23px;">If this new bill manages to make it through the constitutional court as well, the country is going to take a giant step backwards.
