Yahoo [reports][1] that a group of record labels (UMG, Sony, RCA and Warner Brothers Records) are suing American back-bone providers because they allow end-users to download illegal music from [Listen4ever.com][2].

The preposterousness of this aside, should they succeed, a precedent for backbone-level censorship on the internet will be created. Personally, I don&#8217;t condone the illegal download of music (and I also don&#8217;t care if you do download your music like that), but I do feel very strongly about the current freedom of information flow.

Just in case, I&#8217;ll probably start a [Freenet][3] node on my server at home. I would like to see these short-sighted assholes censor freenet.
