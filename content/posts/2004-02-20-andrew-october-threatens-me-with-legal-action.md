Dear friends,

In December 14 of 2003, I read an on-line [article][1] that made me quite
angry. In short, the article told the story of the time-honoured tradition
where kids are encouraged to write letters to Father Christmas (or Santa
Claus). The Post Office in South Africa had made an address available to which
children could send their christmas lists. Andrew October, a South African
journalist, lodged a formal complaint and claimed that this could "break the
fragile spirits" of South African children.

I found this preposterous. Believing in Father Christmas is one of my most
treasured childhood memories, in spite of the fact that he hardly ever brought
what I wanted, and Andrew October was doing his best to take this memory away
from as many children as possible.

I wrote a weblog calling him a "mal-adjusted and incompetent idiot" and a
"recognised moron". Today, October sent me an email threatening with legal
action. It was all the more terrifying because the email came from one of
those yahoo email addresses. The email is reproduced below.

But, because I'm a nice guy, I've decided to remove the nasty parts of [that
weblog][2]. However, I still am of the opinion that October's
attention-seeking actions (NOT him though) were feeble-minded and idiotic.

Thank you.

**See below for the email.**

The content that is deemed inflammatory is:

Andrew October, Cape Town journalist, you are an idiot

Those of you who personally know Andrew October, Cape Town journalist, are
already aware of the fact that he's a mal-adjusted and incompetent
idiot. Those of you who don't know him should read this article.

Andrew October, Cape Town journalist and recognised moron, is doing his best
to destroy Christmas for the children.

Urgh!
