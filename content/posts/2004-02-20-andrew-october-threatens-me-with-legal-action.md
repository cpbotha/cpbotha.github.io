Dear friends,

In December 14 of 2003, I read an on-line [article][1] that made me quite angry. In short, the article told the story of the time-honoured tradition where kids are encouraged to write letters to Father Christmas (or Santa Claus). The Post Office in South Africa had made an address available to which children could send their christmas lists. Andrew October, a South African journalist, lodged a formal complaint and claimed that this could &#8220;break the fragile spirits&#8221; of South African children.

I found this preposterous. Believing in Father Christmas is one of my most treasured childhood memories, in spite of the fact that he hardly ever brought what I wanted, and Andrew October was doing his best to take this memory away from as many children as possible.

I wrote a weblog calling him a &#8220;mal-adjusted and incompetent idiot&#8221; and a &#8220;recognised moron&#8221;. Today, October sent me an email threatening with legal action. It was all the more terrifying because the email came from one of those yahoo email addresses. The email is reproduced below.

But, because I&#8217;m a nice guy, I&#8217;ve decided to remove the nasty parts of [that weblog][2]. However, I still am of the opinion that October&#8217;s attention-seeking actions (NOT him though) were feeble-minded and idiotic.

Thank you.

**See below for the email.**

The content that is deemed inflammatory is:

Andrew October, Cape Town journalist, you are an idiot

Those of you who personally know Andrew October, Cape
  
Town journalist, are already aware of the fact that
  
he&#8217;s a mal-adjusted and incompetent idiot. Those of
  
you who don&#8217;t know him should read this article.

Andrew October, Cape Town journalist and recognised
  
moron, is doing his best to destroy Christmas for the
  
children.

Urgh!
