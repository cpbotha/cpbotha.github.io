Oh, this is SO sweet. This morning a SPAM managed to get past my [SpamAssassin][1] installation. I immediately reported it to the four networks involved in its delivery and at least one has taken immensely pleasing action:

&#8220;Dear Charl,

Thank you for using \****!

We have ternimated the account for \***\***\*\\*\*.\*\***.net. Thank you for
  
reporting the AUP violation.

Please feel free to email us with any questions or comments you may
  
have.

Sincerely,

Basic Tech Support&#8221;

I _love_ it when that happens!
