Computer Professionals. IT Stylists. Computer Engineers. I don&#8217;t know what their preferred labels are, but many of these people need a serious attitude adjustment, preferably in the form of a large hammer to be administered regularly to the head and other soft parts of the body.

You know what I&#8217;m talking about: those people who work with computers yet think they&#8217;re somehow better than than the rest of us. Unskilled labourers who have made peace with the fact that they&#8217;re unskilled labourers are the most pleasant and genuine people you&#8217;ll find. These computer people however, have come to the ridiculous conclusion that they belong to the genus and species _Homo Superior_ and have therefore deserved the right to live in a permanent haze of condescension towards others.

If you are a computer person, programmer, IT consultant or whatever, my message to you is: **At your absolute best, you are no more than very easily replaceable and slightly skilled labour. Please adjust your attitude accordingly.**

Thank you. :)
