One of the most productive days in a long time. I can move mountains quicker now, mostly due to Python, and today I did some serious terraforming. The scary thing is that it’s all so elegant and intuitive on top of it all.

I didn’t think I liked Bush (the music, not the politician, whom I don’t like). It turns out I was wrong. Conveniently so, as [EMusic][1] has a few albums available.

Also played my little part in corrupting [Ben][2] and [Paul][3] with more insidious bits of Py.
