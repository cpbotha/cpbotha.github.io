If you are a rich geek-oriented philanthropist, please buy me [this notebook][1]. I believe the world will be a better place once I am in possession of this super light and super battery-efficient [ATI FireGL 9000][2]-equipped toy.

I almost forgot… it’s probably going to be another year or three before Linux fully supports all this laptop’s features, but for this juicy piece of hardware I’d probably be willing to do my duty as Microsoft’s bitch, at least for a while.

If you as rich samaritan would prefer buying me an [Apple 15″ Powerbook][3] rather, I would probably not complain either.
