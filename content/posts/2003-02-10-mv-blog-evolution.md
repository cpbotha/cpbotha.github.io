[Paul][1] just pointed this out: In Ximian Evolution, open your “Summary” window, Select “Tools|Settings” from the menubar, select the “News Feeds” tab under “Summary Preferences”, click on the “Add news feed” button and add this URL: **http://cpbotha.net/weblogs/cpbotha/index.rdf** Now select this feed from the left hand list and click on the “Add” button in the middle.

Your Evolution summary window will now contain a live listing of my weblog. JOY! Get this URL from any Movable Type weblog by copying the “Syndicate this site (XML)” link.
