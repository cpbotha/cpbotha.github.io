I wish you all a zen-filled 2015! (I think zen trumps straight happiness, because zen means that you&#8217;re on your way to understanding and making peace with the mechanisms underneath the happiness, all the way down.) 

So much has happened since I last stood on this soap-box. However, as [Noeska explains][1], this means I have even _less_ to write about than usual. (for those of you too busy to click: things further back seem far less relevant now, so less motivation to write down) 

(Err oops! First rule of the blogging: We don&#8217;t talk about the blogging.) 

At the start of the Christmas break, I spent a few days in my other home (that&#8217;s The Netherlands for those of you who haven&#8217;t been paying attention) taking part in the joyous occasion of the [double-graduation of two Ph.D. students][2] I had the pleasure of working with. Welcome freshly minted doctors Busking and Kok! May your learning continue every day, and may you make a continuing positive impact on the world around you! 

Once back in extremely sunny South Africa, [TNR, aka DWR][3], and family arrived for two meat-beach-beer-wine-mountain-stomping-good weeks. An interesting point of discussion during this time was whether the DWR could legally deduct all purchase of wine from his income. What a loophole! I saw parts of my neighbourhood I haven&#8217;t seen in decades (hello Paarl Mountain, you are still awe-inspiring!!) and some parts I&#8217;ve never been to before. Here&#8217;s a small selection (yes, that&#8217;s a subtle brag): 

We had lunch and lots of good wine at Solms Delta in Franschoek. Beautiful place, delicious wine, fantastic service. Recommended by this blog(tm)!

I practically used to live on Paarl Mountain. Here&#8217;s a view from Paarl Rock, taken after the wind did its absolute best to try and blow us from Britannica rock. <a href="http://cpbotha.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/wpid-view\_from\_paarl\_rock.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-image-1" data-rl\_title="" data-rl_caption="" title="">

(I also made this [360 degree photo sphere][5] while at the very top of Britannica rock. Go look man!) 

Here&#8217;s the beach in Pringle bay. Water looks lovely, but beware, it&#8217;s a GIANT ICE-BUCKET CHALLENGE!

Finally, the following is not something I personally experienced during my vacation (although some of my best friends are triangles), but just a bit of graphical backyard philosophy by [Ultramegasaurus][6] that floated over my timeline:

  </p></p>

So _that&#8217;s_ why I always get suspicious when successful people offer the advice of &#8220;just be yourself&#8221;! What I think we should do instead? 

_[Be like water my friends.][7]_ 

Have a great week, see you on the other side!
