The newer versions of everybuddy (multi-protocol IM client) were getting progressively worse, at least on my systems. So, by chance I saw that GAim now also has support for IM networks other than AIM through its plugin system. I gave it a shot and I&#8217;m really impressed! It&#8217;s stable on my configurations and supports AIM, ICQ, Yahoo chat, MSN, Jabber, Zephyr and IRC. It even has a napster plugin. The kitchen sink will be included in the next release. In spite of all this, it has a smallish footprint&#8230; aaaaah, IM bliss. Gaim is available from http://gaim.sourceforge.net/.
