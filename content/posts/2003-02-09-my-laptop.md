This is an [AnandTech review][1] of the Hypersonic Sonic Aviator 3.06GHz Pentium 4 laptop which is just another rebadge of the [Clevo][2] 5600. I bought mine (rebadged as a [Promedion][3]) a while back, but with a 2GHz P4 (Northwood) and a Radeon 7500 Mobility instead of a Radeon 9000 Mobility.

In case you didn&#8217;t know, this laptop [does Linux][4].
