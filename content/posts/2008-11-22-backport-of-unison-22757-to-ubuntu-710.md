So you&#8217;ve upgraded _some_ of your machines to Ubuntu 8.10 (Intrepid Ibex, argh) and you&#8217;re really very happy with yourself.  That is, until you try to run your trusty [unison][1] synchronisation scripts and notice that due to the version mismatch between unison on 8.10 (2.27.57) and unison on 7.10 (2.13.16), you are screwed.

Because I like you, I&#8217;ve made available my quick and dirty backport of unison 2.27.57 (the Ubuntu 8.10 version) to Ubuntu 7.10 (Gutsy Gibbon) on i386.  Get the DEBs by clicking [HERE][2]!
