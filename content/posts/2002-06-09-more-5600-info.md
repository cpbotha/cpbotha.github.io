I found [this posting][1] on [groups.google.com][2], bless its heart. It&#8217;s _very_ positive about the Clevo 5600 and mentions that it&#8217;s also marketed as the Fosa 5600, Prostar 5694 and the [Area 51 gaming laptop][3] by [AlienWare][4]. I&#8217;d been drooling about the Area 51 before, but at that time I didn&#8217;t know what the Clevo looked like, so I didn&#8217;t recognise it.
