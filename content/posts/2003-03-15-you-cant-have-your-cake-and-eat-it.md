My laptop is now equipped with 768MB of PC2100 DDR RAM. Wow, a year ago it would have been quite a machine! :)

In anycase, the downside of all this is that it takes about 1.5 minutes to resume from disc with Linux kernel 2.4.21-pre5, acpi 20030228 and swsusp v19. If only ACPI S3 suspend-to-ram worked!
