I think I might have forgotten to tell you that one of the many perks of working at the Stone Three offices is that there&#8217;s a micro-brewery within walking distance. [Triggerfish Brewing][1], as brewery in question is called, was the location of a midweek mini-get-together that ended up looking like this: <figure style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://cpbotha.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/wpid-triggerfish_amber_ale.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-image-0" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title="">

On the topic of not-too-shabby settings for meetings, I finally got around to visiting [Truth Coffee][3] in Cape Town, [described by some][4] as _The best coffee shop in the world_. I was too busy having a good meeting, enjoying the superb coffee, and generally gawking at the fantastic interior and the pretty people (guests and staff) to take any photos, so you&#8217;re going to have to take me on my word and check [some of the photos floating around on the web][5]. 

In between coffee, beer and meetings, I wrote two short nerdy posts at the vxlabs: 

<ul class="org-ul">

    <a href="http://vxlabs.com/2014/06/09/fixing-roundcube-error-in-ddl-upgrade/">Fixing Roundcube 1.0 schema upgrade error</a>
  </li>

  </li>
</ul>

It was pretty awesome to hear that [NASA is thinking pretty seriously about developing a warp drive][6], with which a ship would we able to traverse space at effectively faster than light speeds. It would do this without _locally_ exceeding the speed of light by warping space around the travelling ship, contracting spacetime before the moving ship and expanding it behind it. The ideas are based on a paper by Miguel Alcubierre from 1994 titled [_The warp drive: hyper-fast travel within general relativity_][7], and so this gets to be called the Alcubierre Drive! 

Well now they&#8217;ve gone and [published artist&#8217;s impressions][8] of what such an Alcubierre Drive-equipped ship could look like, and it&#8217;s gorgeous! <figure style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://cpbotha.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/wpid-alcubierre_ship.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-image-1" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title="">

These are pretty exciting times. 

I&#8217;m going to end this post with an acronym I embarrasingly only learnt the meaning of yesterday: LLAP!
