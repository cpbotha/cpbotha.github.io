If you feel like doing me a favour and you have a gmail account, login, click on &#8220;Help&#8221; at the top right, then click on &#8220;Contact Us&#8221; on the left and then on &#8220;Suggest a feature&#8221;. You could also just go directly to <https://services.google.com/inquiry/gmail_suggest/> of course.

Now check the &#8220;Customize &#8216;From:&#8217; address/create an account alias&#8221; box, fill in your email address at the bottom and click on &#8220;Submit&#8221;.

Maybe YOU are destined to be the user that breaks the Camel&#8217;s back, or something.
