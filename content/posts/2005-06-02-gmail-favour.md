If you feel like doing me a favour and you have a gmail account, login, click on “Help” at the top right, then click on “Contact Us” on the left and then on “Suggest a feature”. You could also just go directly to <https: gmail_suggest="" inquiry="" services.google.com=""></https:> of course.

Now check the “Customize ‘From:’ address/create an account alias” box, fill in your email address at the bottom and click on “Submit”.

Maybe YOU are destined to be the user that breaks the Camel’s back, or something.
