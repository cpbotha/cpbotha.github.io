The year is 2008.

  1. A young Iraqi woman falls in love with a British soldier.
  2. Her father hears of this and subsequently, assisted by his two sons, stamps on, suffocates and stabs to death his own daughter.  He is outraged that she has shamed his family in this way.  Furthermore, he claims that she deserved this, as what she did was **_unacceptable to any Muslim that honours his religion_**.
  3. The father is not prosecuted for his barbaric behaviour.  It is apparently on honour killing, and therefore tolerated.  In this case, the police apparently congratulated him.
