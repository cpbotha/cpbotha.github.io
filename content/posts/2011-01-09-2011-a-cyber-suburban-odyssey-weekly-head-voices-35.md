In spite of last year&#8217;s Space Odyssey also not quite panning out as Kubrick and Clarke might have hoped, I had a great year. Sure, it had its fair share of curve-balls, but in terms of personal growth (am I even allowed to use that term? I hope the clich√© police are still on vacation) I am most satisfied. My traditional year-end vacation, as per usual filled with family, friends (slightly less than usual due to genetic offspring #2 related constraints), sun, sand, beer and deep thought, helped wonderfully in my subconscious processing (the most important kind) and integration of the past year&#8217;s events.<figure id="attachment_1159" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1159" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://cpbotha.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/hermanus_new_harbour.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-image-0" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title="">

I&#8217;m still working on my New Year&#8217;s resolutions, because I think it&#8217;s important to have excuses spend time thinking about one&#8217;s ways. There&#8217;s something in there about more concrete planning (I&#8217;m working on a secret list of milestones for 2011), and also about spending more time each day on the [_important_ tasks as opposed to the _urgent_ tasks][1]. How about you?

May your journey in 2011 be at least as cool as the cyber-suburban odyssey I have planned! To get you in the right frame of mind, here&#8217;s a track from the Daft Punk soundtrack of the new [Tron: Legacy movie][2]:

P.S. I&#8217;m so old, I still vividly remember the [first Tron movie][3]. It played a significant role in the shaping of my young character.

P.P.S. I&#8217;ve put my beloved E71 in storage and am now the proud owner of a charge-me-3-times-per-day-please [HTC Desire Z][4] micro-laptop with built-in phone. I&#8217;m going to try and write a post about it soon. Short story: In spite of the battery, I&#8217;m in love again.

P.P.P.S. Go and memorise [Wikipedia&#8217;s list of common misconceptions][5]. Go around correcting as many people as you can. Make new friends!

P.P.P.P.S.
