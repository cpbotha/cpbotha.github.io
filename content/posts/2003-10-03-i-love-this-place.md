Yesterday at 15:55 I placed my order for a [Palm Tungsten E][1] at [The PDA Shop][2]. This morning at about 10:00 the friendly TPG postman delivered it at my door. :)

Specs in short: 320&#215;320 transreflective colour screen, 32MB memory, SDIO slot (for extra flash and peripherals), TI OMAP (ARM) 126MHz processor, a solid collection of software and oodles of prettiness.
