From now on I&#8217;m going to try a more fluid weekly blogging schedule. My approach up to now was to try and write up the weekly right after the weekend, at which time,however, I&#8217;m usually caught up in the usual start-of-the-week storm of, uhm, possibilities, and hence let the blog writing slip, and once you start slipping it&#8217;s a challenge to stop. So now, instead of focusing on the when (the failed after the weekend) I&#8217;m going to focus on the how often. Maybe this works better. 

This past weekend, we visited [Cape Point][1], the almost-southernmost tip of Africa, and the spot where the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean crash together for a part of the year. It&#8217;s quite beautiful, and always great to have visitors that we can take there. I took this photo of the Cape of Good Hope from the Cape Point side:

      My <a href="https://github.com/punchagan/org2blog/pull/159">first significant Emacs Lisp hacking</a> was first <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/10/publishing-wordpress-thumbnail-images-using-emacs-org2blog/">blogged by Sacha Chua</a> (Emacs goddess!) and then accepted into the org2blog upstream repository. Nerd-adrenaline-rush!

      On this topic, I also published <a href="https://github.com/cpbotha/deft-turbo">deft-turbo</a>, my fork of the <a href="http://jblevins.org/projects/deft/">original Deft</a> <a href="http://vxlabs.com/2014/06/04/modify-emacs-deft-for-recursive-directory-search/">to support recursive directory searching</a> and now also multiple file types. If you&#8217;re into Notational Velocity style note-taking and into Emacs you&#8217;ll love this.

    <p>
      I now use Emacs <a href="http://orgmode.org/">Org mode</a> for my daily note-taking, for blogging (this post is being written in Org mode in Emacs) and since yesterday also for generating beautiful presentation slides using the fantastic <a href="https://github.com/yjwen/org-reveal">org-reveal</a>. (As you might recall, I also use <a href="http://vxlabs.com/2014/06/06/configuring-emacs-mu4e-with-nullmailer-offlineimap-and-multiple-identities/">Emacs with mu4e</a> as my email client.)

      It&#8217;s crazy to think that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Emacs">GNU Emacs</a> was first released in March of 1985, which makes it almost 30 years old, which is practically immortal in software terms, and yet it&#8217;s still the most powerful text editor in the world today.

    Finally: The cracked phone screen.

      After a great number of years using smartphones without covers of any kind (they&#8217;re so beautifully designed, why cover that up?) I finally dropped my Nexus 4 from about a metre height because a WhatsApp message arrived and I thought that I could easily fumble my digital friend out of my pocket whilst typing with my other hand.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Apparently I couldn&#8217;t.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The screen acquired an impressive new crack, and the digitizer is completely dead. I&#8217;m having it repaired, because it&#8217;s still a great phone, and Android 5.0 (Lollipop) is being pushed to Nexi 4 worldwide as we speak! (Fortunately I could <a href="https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/4596836?hl=en">factory reset</a> the phone using only the hardware buttons.)
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In the meantime, I&#8217;m using a backup Motorola Atrix 4G. Thanks to Android and much open source hackage, I was able to install Android 4.4.4 (KitKat) on it, in spite of it being a 2011 phone that was practically abandoned by Motorola at the Android 2.3 (Gingerbread) stage.

      Have a great half-week and weekend kids!
