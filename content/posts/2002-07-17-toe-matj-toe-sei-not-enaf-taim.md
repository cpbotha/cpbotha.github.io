The laptop has arrived. It&#8217;s big, it&#8217;s bad and it&#8217;s a bit cranky, which is why I&#8217;ve decided to call it Dr Evil. It racks up a pretty respectable 1700 to 1800 FPS with glxgears and the bleeding edge DRI tree Radeon drivers. There is still a (known) problem w.r.t. switching to a VT and back which I&#8217;ve documented [here][1]. I will let you know if/when this is resolved. I am planning to generate more documentation in the form of a mini-review and of course a Linux howto for this laptop: stay tuned. All in all, I&#8217;m very happy with my purchase.

[This lady][2] is a fine artist. I rate her as one of the better jewels on [EMusic][3]. Take a listen&#8230;

Talking about emusic, I&#8217;ve written a Python script which understands RMPs (the album download format used by EMusic) so people don&#8217;t have to use FreeAMP, which can be buggy sometimes. This script invokes a downloader of your choice to download the MP3s themselves&#8230; this is FAST. At work, I can download an album in about 30 seconds. I&#8217;ll make this script available soon.

I&#8217;ve also written another Python script for renaming/moving MP3s according to embedded ID3V2 information and an arbitrary (freeform) user-supplied pattern. I could not find anything else on Linux that could do this for ID3V2. I&#8217;ll make this available soon too.
