So, a few weeks ago I spring-cleaned _inside_ my trusty little linux server machine before installing the [replacement hard drive][1]. I think I was rewarded with about a kilo of dust and other muck, but at least the machine is now clean. I then replaced the little CPU fan with a brand-new ball bearing fan (4cm). That was a huge improvement, but I was still not happy with the level of noise.

So, today I bought a [Nexus NX-3500][2] &#8220;Real Silent Powel Supply&#8221;. What a difference&#8230; the machine is busy upgrading its [ubuntu][3] installation about 5 metres to my left and I can hardly hear it. This is great.

I think I&#8217;ll still keep the cheap-assed little hardware firewall, but at least I now have a very quiet machine to use as fileserver and linux playground at home.

(PS. if anyone knows of an easy way to cool a Celeron 300A Mendocino passively, I would like to hear about it)
