“In any conflict your fate will depend on your actions. Do not destroy oil wells, a source of wealth that belongs to the Iraqi people.” — Bush addressing the Iraqi people in a [televised speech][1].

I’m sorry, but I really find it very hard not to be very cynical about this carefully worded advice by Bush.
