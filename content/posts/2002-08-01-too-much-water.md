I have come to the conclusion that the Netherlands exist in a subtly alternate dimension. There are several observations which allude to this, but the most prominent and convincing is the physically impossible amount of water that can fall from the sky in a finite time. This would not be possible in the reality that we are used to&#8230; but in the twilight zone of NL it can happen and does, often.

If it were possible to transport the rainfall of 9:00 &#8211; 10:00 this morning to Africa, the Sahara would turn into a lush green oasis. Really.

In other news, I finally completed a first draft of the &#8220;How to install Linux on your Clevo 5600 laptop&#8221; document last night. Start [here][1].
