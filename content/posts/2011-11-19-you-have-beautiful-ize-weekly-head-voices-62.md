I completely lack the genes that usually cause human males to have a thing for cars, but I do love Top Gear. This trailer for a fictional 60s detective show, made by Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond, encapsulates many of the reasons why:

Moustaches, guns, girls, cars and Hammond karate-chopping the porter at Playboy Club London for absolutely no reason whatsoever at 41 seconds can be nothing but 100% pure AWESOME.

It&#8217;s crazily busy at the moment, for a large part due to the extra load of having to teach and revamp, AT THE SAME TIME, the [TU Delft&#8217;s postgraduate Data Visualization course][1]. I&#8217;ve chucked out the written exam and the structured lab work, and exchanged it for paper reading, class discussion and four independent projects, inspired by positive experience with my [Medical Visualization Ninja Training Course][2] (third year in the running, Ninjas all over the place!), the [postgraduate InfoVis course I gave at Stellenbosch][3] and of course the teaching materials of esteemed colleagues at UBC, Harvard, Berkeley and Stanford. With a bit of luck, we will soon deliver a whole class of new-style DataVis Ninjas.

At a recent conference, I ran into an erudite half-British colleague from the far North, who in a few minutes almost managed to turn my world into rubble. You see, I&#8217;ve always proudly promoted the use of the -ise forms of certain words, such as visualise, realise, colonise and so forth, these being examples of British English. (Obviously, I adapt when American English is required.)

It turns out that, as is the case with life in general, it&#8217;s unfortunately not as simple as that.

[It turns out][4] that many of the -ise words are originally from the Greek or the Latin with &#8220;-ize&#8221; endings, and therefore the Oxford spelling prefers their use, although it accepts the &#8220;-ise&#8221; forms as well. On the other hand, the Cambridge University Press, as well as the mainstream media and most of the public in Britain and the former colonies, has a strong preference for the &#8220;-ise&#8221; forms. Certain other words like for example advertise, advise and surprise always take the &#8220;-ise&#8221; form in British English.

So now I&#8217;m faced with this conundrum. It would otherwise not have been such an issue, but the words &#8220;visualise&#8221; and &#8220;visualisation&#8221; come up quite often during my work day. Sticking to &#8220;-ise&#8221; is easier and still correct when in British English mode, but &#8220;-ize&#8221; for those few words of Greek Â and Latin origin could perhaps be considered more correct, and has the great advantage of allowing me to standardise on &#8220;visualize&#8221; as the canonical form of that important term. However, then I would run the risk of confusing the &#8220;-ize&#8221; and the true &#8220;-ise&#8221; words in Oxford English, potentially leading to painful embarrassment at the many cocktail parties that I frequent.

So you see, the Universe is just full of mysteries. Another mystery that has plagued humankind for decades, is what would happen if Stephen Hawking and Albert Einstein got involved in a rap battle. Well humankind, wonder no more:
