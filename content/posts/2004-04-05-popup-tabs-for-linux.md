This weekend, I started playing around with [CoolTabs][1]. This really useful little program attaches to the side of your desktop somewhere and is always available when you need to drop a URL, document or directory. In the same way, it&#8217;s always there when you need to access the files, applications and URLs that you dropped, but without being obtrusive. See the animated screenshots at the bottom of the CoolTabs page.

Under *ix, there&#8217;s [BasKet][2], but that&#8217;s not quite ready yet. The fact that CoolTabs attaches unobtrusively to the side of the desktop is one of the things that makes it so useful and BasKet does not do this yet.

More googling hasn&#8217;t yielded any other *ix equivalents. If I had a bit more time, I&#8217;d attempt making one myself. Maybe it can be done really quickly as a [Super Karamba][3] plugin&#8230;
