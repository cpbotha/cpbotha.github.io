Yes, dear reader(s), I have hacked the radeon drivers so that I can suspend from and resume to an XFree86 server running with active DRI. You can read the low-down [here][1]. There is probably going to be some resistance from the developers, as this is still a kludge. It’s quite a good kludge though, don’t you think?

By the way, please read the posting carefully. Some people haven’t and got the wrong idea…
