I was just chatting to [Jorik][1] who was on about ME this and ME that. So I’m like, “what’s ME”. So Jorik’s like “ME is MoonEdit, a real-time collaborative text editor”. So I’m like, “Oh wow, that’s like SubEthaEdit, the application I’ve secretly been admiring but haven’t been able to run because of an acute lack of MacOS hardware”. So he’s like, “I don’t know what SubEthaEdit is.”

Well, it turns out [MoonEdit][2] is a collaborative text editor (see the movie on their website!), a little like [SubEthaEdit][3], somewhat less slick, but available for Windows and Linux. Go play with it. Collaborative text editing is da bomb.

On a completely unrelated note, [my website][4] has been reincarnated as a MoinMoin wiki. Go look! I am quite happy. It’s exactly the kind of CMS I was looking for.
