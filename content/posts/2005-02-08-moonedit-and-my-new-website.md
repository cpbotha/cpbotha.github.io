I was just chatting to [Jorik][1] who was on about ME this and ME that. So I&#8217;m like, &#8220;what&#8217;s ME&#8221;. So Jorik&#8217;s like &#8220;ME is MoonEdit, a real-time collaborative text editor&#8221;. So I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh wow, that&#8217;s like SubEthaEdit, the application I&#8217;ve secretly been admiring but haven&#8217;t been able to run because of an acute lack of MacOS hardware&#8221;. So he&#8217;s like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what SubEthaEdit is.&#8221;

Well, it turns out [MoonEdit][2] is a collaborative text editor (see the movie on their website!), a little like [SubEthaEdit][3], somewhat less slick, but available for Windows and Linux. Go play with it. Collaborative text editing is da bomb.

On a completely unrelated note, [my website][4] has been reincarnated as a MoinMoin wiki. Go look! I am quite happy. It&#8217;s exactly the kind of CMS I was looking for.
