Why do the clever people at Microsoft persist in labelling their buttons with &#8220;Ok&#8221; and &#8220;Cancel&#8221;, even when these words have almost nothing to do with the actions that will be performed when such a button is clicked? Take this dialogue for instance (I got to look at it many times as I was debugging an ITK memory allocation error with 700MB of data in memory):

It would be fantastic if one of the brightsparks up at Redmond suggested: &#8220;Hey boys, why don&#8217;t we rather label those buttons &#8216;Terminate&#8217; and &#8216;Debug&#8217;?!&#8221; But they probably won&#8217;t, as [labelling buttons with descriptive verbs is Apple territory][2].

Sheesh.
