We went to KÃ¶ln (Cologne, yeah?) this weekend. The Dom is incredible, but I guess that’s what you get if you spend a few hundred years constructing a masterpiece. The Cathedral and the Bazaar? The Cathedral wins, hands down…

Sipping KÃ¶lsch on the bank of the Rhine in the summer sun is also an activity that I can highly recommend. :)

I managed to update [my laptop page][1] as things have been moving quite fast on the DRI front. My kludge idea has been reworked/redone by Michel DÃ¤nzer and it is now actually about ready for prime-time. XFree86 can now seamlessly drop back into software rendering if it can’t regain DRI resources after a VT switch.
