    This WHV deals with the weeks from Monday June 29 to Sunday July 19. I skipped an edition or two whilst away on vacation, as I was quite busy with, you know, being on vacation. So, about that vacation:

    Last year <a href="http://cpbotha.net/2014/07/16/a-south-african-state-of-mindful/">I explained about the Kruger National Park, or KNP</a>. Well, we went again this year, and again it was lovely. It helps that in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mpumalanga">Mpumalanga</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limpopo">Limpopo</a> provinces, &#8220;winter&#8221; at this time of year seems to mean &#8220;lovely balmy days with temperatures between 25 and 30 degrees Celsius&#8221;. What completely and utterly seals the deal, is being surrounded by this particular permutation of natural vastness. You should go there to see for yourself, but here&#8217;s a taste:

    <b>EXTREME-NERDERY BULLET:</b> If you&#8217;re a Dvorak typist using Java-based tools on the Mac (e.g. Eclipse, IntelliJ, AppCode, and everything by JetBrains) you might have noticed that keyboard shortcuts fall on the spectrum somewhere between extremely wonky and plain <i>infuriating</i>. Besides that you now know that this subset of <i>persons</i> is not limited to just you, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/31119280/532513">here&#8217;s an SO answer that I wrote up</a> based on information in the JetBrains bug threads. In short, a long-standing (as in years) bug in Java on Mac means you have to use an open-source tool called <a href="https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/">Karabiner</a> instead of Mac&#8217;s built-in Dvorak support.

    Here, have a photo of a stealthy leopard to recover:

    A Sunday lunch at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thethirstyscarecrow">the Thirsty Scarecrow</a> led to at least two new discoveries. <a href="https://twitter.com/CitizenBeer">Citizen Beer</a>, a craft beer brewery I have not ran into yet (it&#8217;s not for lack of trying, really) makes a pretty delicious amber ale called <i>Alliance</i> (their wonderfully-named <i>Saboteur</i> IPA is not too shabby either):

Very important discovery number 2: You _can_ (and should) deep-fry Oreos!

    I&#8217;m still terrible at these bullets, but I imagine they&#8217;re better than being faced by a wall of text. What do you think?

</ul>

Right peeps, that&#8217;s it for this edition. I wish you a fantastic and especially meaningful week. If at any point you need a little pick-me-up, my baby giraffe is standing by: <figure style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://cpbotha.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wpid-knp_baby_giraffe_2015.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-image-4" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title="">
