I wish you a truly happy 2016, filled with learning and helping other people! Neil deGrasse Tyson, exemplary human, [said it best][1]:

> For me, I am driven by two main philosophies, know more today about the world than I knew yesterday. And along the way, lessen the suffering of others. You&#8217;d be surprised how far that gets you.

Time is fun when you&#8217;re having flies! I can&#8217;t believe that four months have flown by since [the previous WHV][2]. Since then, quite a bunch has happened. Some highlights for me:

  * I spent a week in The Netherlands, my other home, taking part in a second hackathon with the Evalueserve peeps (the previous one was in Gurgaon in India). This was again loads of fun, and we managed to build a significant new shippable feature (measurable value!) almost from scratch.
  * In October, I went back to The Netherlands (it&#8217;s my other home, remember) for 2.5 days to take part in the Doctorification of [a friend][3]. Besides the doctorification process (I&#8217;ve been out of academia for a while, so my terminology might not be 100%) which went swimmingly, I had so many high-intensity interactions with some of my favourite people that I literally almost missed my flight back. Just picture me waking up in Delft at 8:30 with a flight leaving from Amsterdam at 10:00&#8230;
  * For a work project,  I started programming in [Apple&#8217;s Swift][4]. As compiled high-performance languages go, this one has a number of modern language features which make it a truly interesting addition to one&#8217;s programming toolbox.
  * Further on the nerd-front, I&#8217;m trying to get more of us to [use Signal instead of WhatsApp][5] whenever possible.
  * We spent so many weekends and the Christmas vacation doing fun outdoorsy stuff (living at the southern tip of Africa has serious perks), not least of which was a trip up Table Mountain for the first time in 15 years. See the photo up top for an impression.

I have some fun changes in mind for this blog in 2016, but you&#8217;re going to have to stick around to find out what they are, so&#8230; see you later peeps!
