I spend quite a chunk of my time hacking on [VTK][1] (the Visualization ToolKit), one of the better examples of open source.

I&#8217;m particularly proud of the fix I made today though, as it&#8217;s quite deep in the VTK object hierarchy. Shows you how much it can help to construct an isolated test case that breaks something before you start debugging. First I present [the problem][2] along with my test case (I ran into the problem whilst hacking on large GUI+VTK project) and then, after considerable amounts of Rooibos tea, [the solution][3].

This one-liner fix represents an extremely hairy problem: it was hidden somewhere in the 1.2 MILLION lines of code that constitute VTK.
