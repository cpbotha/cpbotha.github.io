I grew up on a healthy mix of Marvel, DC and other super-hero comics, but the Iron Man made a particularly deep impression on me. The idea of fabricating and donning an almost-invincible metal suit and then flying around and kicking idiot ass all over the show really appealed to my nerdish sensibilities.

If [the trailer][1] is anything to go by, [the 2008 movie][2] is going to rock so incredibly hard.  Robert Downey Junior is the male lead, which is already a good indication, but the fact that they’ve actually went and used [Black Sabbath][3]‘s <a data-rel="lightbox-video-0" href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=udEDlOZJmCc" title="Youtube video of Black Sabbath doing Iron Man at Ozzfest">Iron Man</a> in the sound track is a sure sign that _someone_ knows _exactly_ what they’re doing.

YEAH!
