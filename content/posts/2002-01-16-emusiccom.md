I’ve taken the “plunge” and joined [emusic.com][1] for three months. If you’re into mainstream, stay away… if you’re into somewhat more interesting music (Funker Vogt, Covenant, Front Line Assembly, Napalm Death, some more relaxed stuff I don’t know) this is definitely worth it.

Otherwise, I’m trying to finish an article for the SPIE before I can get back to yummy volume visualisation and musculo-skeletal modeling.
