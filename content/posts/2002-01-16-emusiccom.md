I&#8217;ve taken the &#8220;plunge&#8221; and joined [emusic.com][1] for three months. If you&#8217;re into mainstream, stay away&#8230; if you&#8217;re into somewhat more interesting music (Funker Vogt, Covenant, Front Line Assembly, Napalm Death, some more relaxed stuff I don&#8217;t know) this is definitely worth it.

Otherwise, I&#8217;m trying to finish an article for the SPIE before I can get back to yummy volume visualisation and musculo-skeletal modeling.
