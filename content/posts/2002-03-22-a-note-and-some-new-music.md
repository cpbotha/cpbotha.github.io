Keep your eyes on [XVid][1]. This is also an [OpenDivX][2]-derived codec, but it&#8217;s open source. According to all reports and tests, this seems to be good competition for DivX4. As soon as it&#8217;s more accessible or I have more time, I can start playing with it.

[Clan Of Xymox][3] came to my attention recently on EMusic. This is rather interesting Alternative/Goth/Industrial that reminds one of vintage Sisters of Mercy with some Cure thrown in for kicks. I can highly recommend this.
