HARR HARR! I kicked it in the crotch when it wasn&#8217;t paying attention.

Yes ladies and jelly-beans, the draft of my PhD thesis is finally done. Not bad, if I might say so myself. My PhD contract ended on September 15, today is the 21st. 6 days overtime.

Lest I forget: On September 16, I was officially appointed as PostDoc in the [Visualisation group][1] of the TU Delft. In other words, I&#8217;m staying just where I am, except that now I&#8217;m getting paid BUCKET LOADS of cash.

ps. One statement in the paragraph above is not entirely true.
