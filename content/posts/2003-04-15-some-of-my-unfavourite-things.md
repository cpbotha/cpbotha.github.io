I was going to write about some of my favourite things, but unfortunately I had to read the news first. [This article][1] came to my attention. In short, Tom Hurndall, a member of the International Solidarity Movement, was _shot in the head_ by an Israeli when he tried to rescue a small child from gunfire. He died shortly after in a nearby hospital.

I have very little sympathy for the Israeli aggressors. The fact that they are [funded and advised][2] by the Americans does not improve this situation.
