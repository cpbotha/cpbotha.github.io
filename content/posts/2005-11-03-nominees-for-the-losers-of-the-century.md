I&#8217;m trying to decide between these two nominees for the award of &#8220;Losers of the Century&#8221; (play dramatic Oscar theme here): On the one hand we have [Mensa][1], a society for people with IQs in the top 2% of the population (\*getting nauseous\*) and on the other hand we have the [International High IQ Society][2], in this case for people in the top 5% of the population. This society claims to foster &#8220;intellectual thinking&#8221;. Snigger.

The members of these societies have become so caught up in a human-constructed &#8220;intelligence test&#8221; and what this might imply about their mental prowess, that they feel that they have to cluster together in these sad little groups to chat about how profound they consider their thoughts to be. There is no real other theme or shared interest besides an over-inflated sense of self-worth. Nice!

Voting starts now.
