Week 31 of 2014, which was otherwise pretty uneventful except for bunches of hard work, ended with a trip up to the West Coast to go see the flowers. 

YES PEOPLE SPRING IS JUST AROUND THE CORNER! 

I made you a photo of this ominous looking Portal To _Soooooomething_: <figure style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://cpbotha.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/wpid-gates\_to\_somewhere\_geelbek\_restaurant.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-image-0" data-rl\_title="" data-rl\_caption="" title="">![][1]</a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">These look like the gates to some far-off fantasy plane. Instead, it&#8217;s the Geelbek Restaurant in the West Coast National Park, which does serve mysteriously delicious chocolate cake.</figcaption></figure> 

Just so you don&#8217;t think it was overcast and non-Springy everywhere, I can assure you that those funny clouds were _only_ over the respawning portal. Everywhere else it looked like this 360 degree photosphere I made for you (hey, we live in the future, I can show you 360 degree pannable photos; go on, pan and zoom with your mouse, or just wave your hands if you have your VR helmet on):

(I made the photosphere at the [Grootvlei Guest Farm &#8211; On the Dunes House][2].) 

Because clever people told me so, or more probably because I misunderstood them, I thought that I needed to do my Big Thinking Tasks (BTIs, for example trying to get the architecture of a new system down) in the morning. However, by the time afternoon came around, I would be too tired to take care of the MITs (Most Irritating Tasks, usually admin), and hence would postpone them till the day after, when they would just get postponed again, ad infinitum. 

I recently started taking care of a few MITs first thing in the morning. This way, I actually get them done, and the BTIs still (mostly) fit. 

Just to clarify things, [MITs are also used by zenhabits][3], except there they call them Most Important Tasks. Whoops. For the sake of exposition, and to make everything more muddy, let&#8217;s call them zMITs, and my MITs iMITs (&#8220;i&#8221; is for irritating, as in iPhone, iPad, and so forth). In any case, zMITs are also to be done first thing in the morning, and at least one of the zMITs should advance your goals, let&#8217;s call it the zOMG. 

Putting all of this together, I should probably start off my day by taking care of my zOMG, then a few iMITs, some zMITs and then finally the BTIs. YEAH! 

I&#8217;m going through a little reading revival. After finishing Remote last week, I&#8217;m time-slicing between the following books at the moment: 

<ul class="org-ul">
  <li>
    <i>PostgreSQL: Up and Running</i> &#8211; I shouldn&#8217;t be telling you this, but there is just so much wow in Postgres. I&#8217;m currently using the text analysis functionality, and noticing that my SQL needs some advancing, hence the book.
  </li>
  <li>
    <i>A Tour of C++ by Bjarne Stroustroup</i> &#8211; Everybody&#8217;s talking about C++11 and C++14. I was curious about the newer features, and Dr Stroustroup seems to know his way around the language. (In my hobby projects, C++ and Lua are playing an increasingly important role.)
  </li>
  <li>
    <i>Programming in Scala</i> &#8211; I don&#8217;t have serious plans with this at the moment, but felt I needed to be sufficiently informed to have vigorous arguments about its utility.
  </li>
  <li>
    <i>Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman</i> &#8211; fascinating book about how the human brain functions in two parts: fast, efficient and intuitive, vs. slow, energy-heavy and rational.
  </li>
  <li>
    <i>The Psychology of Influence by Robert Cialdini</i> &#8211; another fascinating book about how exactly humans influence each other.
  </li>
</ul>

I&#8217;m all out of fiction at the moment. If you have recommendations of so-called Hard SF and/or Space Opera, I&#8217;m all ears! 

Talking about Science Fiction, I ran into this marvellous clip showcasing the awesome products of [Clinical Graphics][4]:

Damnit I&#8217;m so proud of Dr Krekel and his team!
