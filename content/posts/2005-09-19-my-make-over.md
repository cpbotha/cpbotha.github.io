So, as some of you might know I had a sort of make-over on monday morning, september 12, 2005. Here are some before and after photos: <a href="http://cpbotha.net/thingies/cpbotha\_after\_defence\_before\_dr.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-image-0" data-rl\_title="" data-rl\_caption="" title="">Before</a> and <a href="http://cpbotha.net/thingies/cpbotha\_after\_dr.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-image-1" data-rl\_title="" data-rl\_caption="" title="">after</a>.

The first photo shows all the wonderful people that showed up to watch me defend my work and the esteemed gentlemen (in fancy garb) who opposed me. The second photo was taken right after I received that red thingy. The red thingy means that you may now call me Doctor Charl if that sort of thing takes your fancy.
