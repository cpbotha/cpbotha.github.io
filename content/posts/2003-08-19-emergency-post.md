Because my blog page had emptied itself due to a lack of posting (I think that it got severely depressed), I deemed it necessary to post _something_ to remedy this situation. Because I&#8217;m profoundly busy with non-blog things, it&#8217;s going to have to be a screenshot.

Click on this DSCAS3 logo: <a href="http://visualisation.tudelft.nl/~cpbotha/thingies/dscas3screenshot20030815.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-image-0" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title="">![][1]</a> to see a screenshot of my super-duper, ultra-useful and quasi-sentient DSCAS3 software. Because I like to irk bigots of any kind, the screenshot is of the Windows version. :)
