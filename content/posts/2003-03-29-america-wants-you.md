[Ed&#8217;s weblog][1] is a reliable source of political edification and enlightenment. You should go there regularly.

In anycase, a [posting][2] he made recently deserves some amplification. Ed cites [this Guardian article][3] reporting on Richard Perle&#8217;s resignation from his position as chairman of the Pentagon&#8217;s Defence Policy Board. This gentleman is also lovingly nicknamed &#8220;The Prince of Darkness&#8221;.

More importantly however, is the fact that Perle is cited as the principal author of a 1996 report titled &#8220;Clean Break&#8221;. This report, without so much as a blush, sets out a master plan that is designed to reshape the Middle East to be more compatible with the strategic interests of Israel. The course of action starts out with a violent shake-up of the current regime in Iraq, very similar to what we&#8217;re seeing now.

This plan fits in very neatly with [yet another dastardly design][4] formulated by some of Dubya&#8217;s buddies even before The Eloquent One succeeded in becoming leader of the blind (for the less astute readers: This has been planned _before_ George W. Bush ran for president and _before_ 9/11). To quote from [that link][4]:

&#8220;The plan shows Bush&#8217;s cabinet intended to take military control of the Gulf region whether or not Saddam Hussein was in power. It says: &#8216;The United States has for decades sought to play a more permanent role in Gulf regional security. While the unresolved conflict with Iraq provides the immediate justification, the need for a substantial American force presence in the Gulf transcends the issue of the regime of Saddam Hussein.&#8217;

The PNAC document supports a &#8216;blueprint for maintaining global US pre-eminence, precluding the rise of a great power rival, and shaping the international security order in line with American principles and interests&#8217;.&#8221;

I find this almost surreal. Usually, one makes some effort to disguise imperialism&#8230;

PNAC is of course the [Project for the New American Century][5]. It has [a website][5] where you can read what America is planning for you. It mostly comes down to the fact that if you don&#8217;t live in a America, your country will be terraformed until you hardly notice the difference!

In short: this war has been planned for a very long time and the Americans are _NOT_ doing it to liberate the Iraqi people. When this war draws to an end, it won&#8217;t be long before America goes to work on the next inferior culture, so get ready for a terrible and bumpy ride.
