The whole music video was shot with high-speed video in one single, glorious 4.2 second take, and then played back at “normal” speed to result in this mind-blowing end-product:

<div class="fb-video" data-allowfullscreen="true" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/okgo/videos/10153836041340683/">
</div>

(BTW, since when are facebook videos a thing? Fortunately, WordPress immediately understood the facebook video link I pasted and correctly embedded it.)
