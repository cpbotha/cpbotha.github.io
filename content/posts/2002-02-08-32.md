[Rudolph][1] has arrived!

I&#8217;ve been as sick as a dog these past few days. Your standard MoFo winter cold, but then with a baseball-bat and sneakers. It seems to have subsided quite quickly, probably partly due to the megadoses of vitamins I have been taking and the 10 hours of sleep every night. I actually did not have time for this, as I&#8217;m attending a mathematical morphology course by the likes of Rein van den Boomgaard, Lucas van Vliet, Henk Heijmans and Pierre Soille. If you know anything about morphology, you&#8217;ll know that these boys represent a serious chunk of research and innovation in the field.
