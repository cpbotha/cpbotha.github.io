I&#8217;ve always been a fan of python. So much so that I&#8217;ve embedded it in large C++ applications of mine to enable weird and wonderful extensions. However, I&#8217;ve always thought of it as just as scripting language, albeit a very flexible and clean one. These past few days I&#8217;ve been spending some time with more serious [Python][1] and [Tix][2] (Tk megawidgets) applications programming and I must say, I am really impressed. On modern hardware the advantages of creating applications this way **far** outstrip the disadvantages&#8230;

Stay tuned.
