Welcome back friends!

It's a lovely, laid-back Sunday morning (the 8th, at 11:16 to be slightly more
precise) as I sit down to write this paragraph right here.

Smatterings of this post were already jotted down in this markdown text file
two weeks ago, but then I didn't see enough that was noteworthy, and then
everything suddenly Got Really Busy(tm).

In the end, all of that led up to this perfect little moment in space-time
right here and right now, and now I am grateful that I can try again to look
back at the passage of time from Monday November 18 to Sunday December 8, 2019.

## Lecturing, old school.

On Thursday, November 21, I gave a two hour lecture titled "IoMT in Healthcare
Innovation" at the [University of Stellenbosch Business
School](https://www.usb.ac.za/).

IoMT expands to the ["Internet of Medical
Things"](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2018/01/25/why-the-internet-of-medical-things-iomt-will-start-to-transform-healthcare-in-2018/#46f18c694a3c).

My knowledge of IoT is spotty, and before giving this lecture I didn't even
know that the term "IoMT" existed.

Fortunately, it turns out that a lot of what we're currently doing at Stone
Three Healthcare (connecting patients with specialist care through
diagnostic-grade streaming of auscultation (and soon other modalities) device
data) can in fact be classified as IoMT.

Phew.

I would like to make the following observations based on this experience:

1. I still really love getting up in front of a group of people to present
   something. There are so many things that could go wrong, but when they go
   right, the experience is great.
2. A two hour lecture is quite long, for both the students, even when they're
   as advanced as this, *and* for the lecturer, especially when he is as out of
   practice as this.
   - If there's a next time, I will either insert my own 15 minute break, or I
     will get the class to break out into some sort of topic-strengthening
     activity.
3. I had somehow forgotten how much time lecture preparation could take up,
   even when you just had to present your own day-to-day reality.
   - BIG UP TO THE LECTURERS IN THE WHV AUDIENCE!

## Productivity system tuneup.

Last Sunday morning, as the family took a last swim at Kraalbaai before we had
to return home, I tried to apply some serious thinking (well, I did this by
stringing together a series of normal thinking moments) to the problem of
increasing my efficiency and focus at work.

At that moment, the scenery outside looked like this:

Regular readers will know that coming up with new ways to increase and maintain
focus is a life-long endeavour, which my subconscious self enjoys inventing
interesting new ways to subvert.

Conscious me has made peace with the fact that it has no choice but to keep on
working at its end of the bargain, until the very end.

With the opposing forces involved, my focus seems to oscillate with varying
frequencies between terrible and not too bad.

Anyways, having had a few days of fresh air and majestic scenery to jog the
neural circuitry, I applied myself, again, to the problem at hand.

I thought that sketching could help, so I was scribbling using a rather
impressive electronic pencil-analogue on a glass screen.

After several focused minutes (SEVERAL MINUTES, I TELL YOU!), I had a mindmap
with "increase efficiency" in a little oval at the center, arrows pointing
outwards into three terribly familiar habits, each in a rectangle *this* time,
and finally more connecting lines to lists of pretty plausible sounding reasons
for the three well-known habits.

The three rectangles were:

1. Morning planning.
2. Inbox 0.
3. Pomodoro always.

Over the years, these three items have made pretty regular appearances, in
various different forms, on this blog.

(I laughed when I just looked up [this old 2010
post](/2010/09/20/an-indecent-proposal-weekly-head-voices-31/) and found a
pretty effective focus technique in the comments.)

Anyways, although the little thinking and drawing session documented here
seemingly did not result in any new revelations, the act of going through the
whole thought process, and documenting the results (again), seemed to have
contributed to a pretty great week in terms of focus.

I wrote down a little mantra for myself (definitely not fit for publication),
weaving together the three points above and the reasoning behind them, almost
like the affirmation in Wreckit Ralph's bad guy support group:

> I'm bad, and that's good. I will never be good, and that's not bad. There's
> no one I'd rather be than me.

One of the most valuable lessons I learned from a book I once read about
procrastination (I'll look up the name later), is that it can make all the
difference once you explicitly verbalise, to yourself, that you have *chosen*
to take on difficult task X or Y.

Just saying these words somehow changes one's perception from being stuck with
difficult task X or Y, i.e. passive, to having taken agency, and having *decided*
to *commit*, i.e. active.

My humble focus mantra is following in this tradition.

(I really hope that my subversive sub-conscious is not paying attention right
now...)

## Starship GOU #1, taxiing on the runway.

Wednesday, December 4, was officially [GOU
#1's](/about/weekly-head-voices-abbreviations/) last day of primary school.

Although she seemed to navigate this emotional event with her customary
even-keeled demeanour, some of the moments were really just too big to let go by
without a good cry or two.

I was also happy to observe the level of retrospection and sunny candour she
applied to her informal post hoc analyses of above-mentioned crying moments.

I really hope that she strengthens and maintains this important human ability.

From our perspective as parents, it feels like the stakes are being raised
quite significantly.

The thing is, our oldest is now quite obviously becoming an adult.

It's like that scene at the end of the brilliant 2015 movie [Inside
Out](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2096673/), where the protagonist's brain
console is suddenly upgraded to one with at least 9000 new knobs and dials.

Up to now, we (the parents) were GOU #1's only control system.

Now it is becoming quite clear that she is increasingly forming her own
opinions, and making her own decisions.

In most cases, the physical constraints of a 13 year old living in her parent's
house still afford us some level of control.

However, relying on that would be missing the point entirely.

You see, we find ourselves in the moment of truth, when the past 13 years of
mostly gentle programming has to start executing all by itself.

Our little GOU #1, our first co-created human intelligence, is preparing to go
out into the world.

She has not taken off yet, so we do our best to apply the final touches to her
already promising software.

We exhort her regularly: *Be useful. Use your (rational) brain. Be kind. Find
the kindness in others.*

In the darkness, when we are at our weakest, stripped down to our core, we do
what all parents do:

We worry, and we hope with a passion, the intensity of which it is difficult to
describe, that our offspring units do manage to [generate their own motivation,
to manufacture meaning, and to create
love](/2012/03/04/rhythm-of-the-night-weekly-head-voices-66/#life-philosophy-that-works).
