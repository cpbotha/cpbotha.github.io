Welcome to 2020 folks!

In retrospect, I really should have written this post during the vacation, when
it is substantially easier to wax all optimistic about the year to come.

As it stands, we're slightly more than a week of work into the new year, and
most of that vacation naivet√© has been brought summarily crashing down to earth
as part of a sort of planetary body check.

Perhaps it's better this way after all. Let's keep it real.

podcast about a recent 50 mile race between humans and horses</a>. (Hint: A human won!)

During the vacation, I did manage to find all (most?) of [the previous (year)
transition posts](/tags/transition/) all the way back to 2010 and retro-tag
them, for your and my reading pleasure, but mostly because I like to keep
things orderly around here.

The rest of this post is a very brief and spotty review of 2019, followed by my
far-more-grounded-than-usual (see above) hopes and dreams for 2020.

## Learnings and events that I found important, through the lens of this blog.

I now find [sleep](/tags/sleep/) *at least* as important as healthy eating (and
[not
eating](/2019/12/18/weekly-head-voices-186-helderberg-20/#time-restricted-eating-tre-with-black-coffee-please))
and exercise for human wellness. I started writing about sleep in the [2017 to
2018 transition post](/2017/12/29/the-2017-to-2018-transition-post/) after
reading about Matthew Walker for the first time in a Guardian interview.

In 2019 I got around to reading his book as well, and I now I'm even more
scared of losing sleep over anything.

(For a giggle, contrast this with [my early morning work sessions in WHV
 #161](/2019/02/06/weekly-head-voices-161-email-equilibrium/#earlyish-morning-sessions). On
 second thought, in Summer time one could probably get this working again.)

Our home is [now solar
 powered](/2019/06/30/weekly-head-voices-172-abc/#solar-powerrrrrrrr). In fact,
 this post is for the largest part made using power directly from the sun!

[Stone Three
 Healthcare](/2019/07/17/weekly-head-voices-173-i-know/#stone-three-healthcare-is-now-a-thing),
 a new med-tech company I am officially part of, was officially launched after
 a great incubation period.

Exciting times lie ahead. 

[Reality is just a different type of
dreaming](/2019/07/25/weekly-head-voices-174-i-row-row-row-your-boat/#life-is-but-a-dream),
and other implications of brain-based reality simulation.

We are still feeling [the loss of a clan mother](/2019/09/01/weekly-head-voices-176-cycle-of-life/#loss).

[ABC stands for Always Be
Compounding](/2019/06/30/weekly-head-voices-172-abc/#always-be-compounding).

Maybe *that* will be my main theme for 2020.

## Blogging Stats.

In 2019 I published 35 posts on this blog, slightly down from 2019's 36 posts.

(I also published 12 more nerdy posts over on vxlabs, slightly up from 2019's 11 posts.)

The static log analyzer tool I installed in March of 2019 (awstats, if you have
to know) reports 37403 unique visitors reading just under 160000 pages between
them.

It could be that all of that is due to my small group of friends voraciously
re-reading everything on here, each time with a new dynamically assigned IP
address.

Whatever the case may be (voracious) readers, thank you for reading the things
I write!

## Technical changes to the site, with implications for the writing process.

In March of this year, I [ported this whole site from wordpress to the Hugo
static site generator](/2019/03/31/wordpress-to-hugo/).

Although this has resulted in a significantly faster and more secure site, the
real benefits only dawned on me a few weeks in.

With Hugo, my main input modality is the humble text editor, where I write the
[markdown](https://commonmark.org/help/), that is semi-structured plaintext
with a few tricks, of each post before converting it to its final published
form.

In contrast to the WYSIWYG of Wordpress and especially of its new-fangled
Gutenberg visual editor, the latter which was probably the biggest reason for
me to make the jump, I see only text and the markdown heading structure when I
write posts, with very few other distractions.

This has magically resulted in me applying significantly more focus and
discipline to how I write these posts, which has further resulted in an
unexpected increase in writing satisfaction.

(I am carefully optimistic that it might even contribute ever so slightly to
post quality.)

In November of 2019, I also moved all 20 years of super valuable (to me) reader
comments [away from the Disqus silo and into a self-hosted open-source
commenting system called
isso](/2019/11/10/we-now-have-self-hosted-isso-comments/).

## Running.

In 2019, Strava says I ran 1086km, down from over 1200km in 2018.

I am happy with this.

At the start of 2019, [I slowed down a bit
(again)](/2019/02/06/weekly-head-voices-161-email-equilibrium/#running-inspiration)
to help save my ankles.

That seemed to have worked, because I had no mentionable injuries for the rest
of the year, and *that* makes me happier than more distance would have.

For the sake of this retrospective, I do have to note that I did attain my
secret-until-unlock extra 2019 running goal, namely [the casual 20km
jog](/2019/11/22/weekly-head-voices-184-the-tai-chi-of-you/#running) on one
not-too-hot Saturday morning in November.

For 2020, my main goal is simply to continue running throughout the year (see
ABC above) without injury.

The secret additional milestone has not yet been formulated.

(I still enjoy running the most on barefoot or sandals, but for the longer
runs, I am really happy to have made the [Altra connection in
September](/2019/09/09/weekly-head-voices-177-streakers/#escalante).)

## Plans and life directions for 2020.

The [January 6, 2019 transition WHV were definitely more
ambitious](/2019/01/06/the-2018-to-2019-transition-post/#other-plans-for-2019)
than I currently feel.

Traditionally, Experiment Alcohol Zero (EAZ) starts around this time and then
continues for a month or more.

That's a great tradition, so Monday, January 6, 2020 marks the date this time
around.

Other than EAZ and my humble running goals, it is probably relevant to mention
my recently started experimental daily list of life directions.

At the start of 2012, [I wrote the following about life
goals](/2012/01/28/slow-philosophy-weekly-head-voices-64/):

> Don't set life goals, but rather set life directions. Instead of defining the
> point that you want to go towards, define your preferred direction. If you do
> it right, you'll pass those points as you go along in any case, except you
> won't land in the depressing goal vacuum right after reaching the point that
> you've been moving towards for so long, because you're motoring along in a
> direction, and that's what's important.

(I should have added then that life goals, especially the new year's resolution
variety, are also incredibly easy to fail at.)

Finally applying this advice concretely to my [note-taking / PKM
system](/2019/09/21/note-taking-strategy-2019), I have recently added an
"Experiment: Articulate your directions / systems" heading to [the daily
planning template](/2019/09/21/note-taking-strategy-2019/#daily-review).

In other words, every(ish) morning during day planning, I *attempt* to write
down (again...) my current life directions.

This is a neat trick to force me to be reminded multiple times per week of
these guidelines.

It also gives me the opportunity to adapt the wording, or even the list
itself. Your surroundings change continuously, and so do you.

The most recent version is as follows:

0. nurture your clan.
1. grow the business.
2. keep on writing, also for publication.
3. keep on programming, also for publication.
4. keep on learning, and sharpen tools.
5. optimise physiology.

All of these are
[*compounding*](/2019/06/30/weekly-head-voices-172-abc/#always-be-compounding).

None of them are concrete goals which I can quantitatively attain.

They are all *directions of movement*, along which any decision or action can
be measured.

If that action furthers one or more of the six directions above, we are good to
go.

If not, it's probably time to go to bed.

## Wishes for 2020.

Dear readers, **thank you for being here**.

I wish you a brilliant 2020.

I look forward to all of our meetings, both here on these pages, and everywhere
else where they may happen.
