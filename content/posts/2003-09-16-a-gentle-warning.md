Yesterday was September 15, exactly 3 years after I officially started with my Ph.D. Time is fun when you&#8217;re having flies! This means that today I have just under a year left to go, which in turn means that the stress is beginning to pile up.

I apologise in advance if I accidentally bite your head off.
