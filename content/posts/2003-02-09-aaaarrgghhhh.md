I quote from the [Movable Type Movable Type User Manual: AUTHORS AND PERMISSIONS][1]: “You can edit your own authoring permissions by selecting your own name from the pulldown menu. Be careful when doing this, however, particularly with respect to turning off author-editing permissions for yourself. If you turn off your author-editing permissions, you will be unable to turn them back on.”

I’ve gone and done this on all the blogs of the other users on my installation, so that I don’t get listed as author on the blogs that I don’t have anything to do with. Now I’m obviously not able to change author permissions on those blogs, which is something that I do want to be able to do!
