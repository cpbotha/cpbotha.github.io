Finally I too went to see Reloaded. We went to a particularly cozy little cinema in Delft called The Apollo. This is a &#8220;Service Bioscoop&#8221;, meaning that you have a little table in front of you and can press a button to have a waiter pop by and serve your favourite drinks and snacks. Smoking is also allowed. As we haven&#8217;t been taking part in this in- and exhalation-driven activity for a while now, this point isn&#8217;t _so_ high up on the list of advantages, but it definitely does contribute to the cozy atmosphere. We will most definitely be going back there&#8230; In case you were wondering: No, the big screens and digital sound systems of the surrounding cities are unable to drag us away from our beloved Delft, thank you. There&#8217;s nothing like taking a relaxed walk back home from the cinema along a Delftse gracht.

Iiiiiin anycase, I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Wanting to read someone else&#8217;s interpretation afterwards, I stumbled upon this much quoted analysis: [Corporate Mofo Reloads The Matrix][1]. It&#8217;s short but chock-full of philosophical goodness. If you haven&#8217;t read it already, it&#8217;s definitely worth at least five of your precious minutes.
