Welcome everyone to the 238th edition of the Weekly Head Voices, this one
covering the week from Monday, January 31 to Sunday, February 6, 2022.

I would like to get you started with some flowers, after which there is a
possibly boring bit about improving my keyboard, followed by a final bit with a
quote which I think is a bit more than just a two-bit quote.

## Womier K87 keyboard: Customization unlocked! {#womier-k87-keyboard-customization-unlocked}

You might remember from [WHV #235 that I was quite happy with my new Varmilo
VA87m mechanical keyboard](/2021/10/28/weekly-head-voices-235-speed-silvers/#yet-another--new-keyboard-yank) and that I was also quite surprised to learn that I
might prefer _linear_ switches over _tactile_, thanks to the super smooth Cherry MX
Speed Silver switches.

Furthermore, its stabilisers were exceptionally smooth, and quiet. It taught me
that one did not have to live with rattly stabilisers.

As is often the case with new knowledge, this made me re-evaluate my
relationship with my other keyboard, the Womier K87 (aka "RGB-with-unicorns"),
which was introduced here in [WHV #204](/2020/09/16/weekly-head-voices-204-what-is-your-purpose/#keyboard-update-unicorns-with-rgb).

You see, that board came with both _tactile_ switches (Gateron browns), and with
rattly [stabilisers](https://switchandclick.com/stabilizer-guide/).

... and so it came to pass that I ordered 90 Cherry MX Red switches from
[Ctrl.Shift.Esc](https://www.ctrlshiftesc.co.za/), as well as a super cheap (R109 when I ordered, it seems the
price has just doubled!) 100g tube of SPANJAARD silicone paste.

The red switches are quintessentially linear. They have a more conventional
actuation distance of 2mm versus the perhaps too-quick-for-me 1.2mm of the
speed silvers.

Plus, they were in stock.

I selected the SPANJAARD silicone paste as a cheap local alternative after
reading more than I ever wanted to know about lubricants and greases for
respectively the switches themselves and the stabilisers.

(I'm just kidding, this is exactly the sort of thing I love knowing everything
about.)

On the evening of Monday, January 31, our dinner table looked like this:

{{< figure src="womier-red-switches-in-progress.jpg" caption="<span class=\"figure-number\">Figure 2: </span>Brown switches out, reds are in. I kept those three browns top right for comparison. The white cap puller was much faster for me than the wire one above the keycaps." link="womier-red-switches-in-progress.jpg" >}}

Shortly after that, I was typing on the "new" board, entirely unconvinced that
the switch (haha) had been worthwhile.

As I'm typing this, it's a more than a week later, and I am now entirely
convinced.

Based on how they feel, and an improvement of my typing speed and accuracy on
these switches relative to brown, I am hereby joining team linear!

With regard to the rattly stabs: On February 2 I removed the spacebar,
backspace and return keys, disassembled the stabilisers, and coated the wire
ends in as much silicone paste as I could. Although not quite at Varmilo
levels, the three respective stabilisers have improved massively, and have
convincingly crossed my satisfaction threshold.


## Live deep and suck out all the marrow of life {#live-deep-and-suck-out-all-the-marrow-of-life}

I used to encourage friend PK, and probably others (and probably most often
just myself), but he usually just _got it_, with the following: "Please remember
to squeeze out every last drop from that experience".

There was a distinctly visual, almost palpable, element to this wish.

You have to imagine somehow grabbing the moment in question, and then wringing
it out like a wet towel to extract every last iota of juicy experience.

As I'm desperately scrambling here for the right words to describe precisely
the intention, you can image how happy I was to run into the following quote by
Henry David Thoreau just the other day:

> I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the
> essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and
> not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. I did not wish to live
> what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practise resignation,
> unless it was quite necessary. I wanted **to live deep and suck out all the
> marrow of life**, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that
> was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a
> corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms... -- Henry David Thoreau ([ref](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/2690-i-went-to-the-woods-because-i-wished-to-live))

(I just spent some time on [Thoreau's wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_David_Thoreau). It turns out it was not
just this quote, he was an impressive human.)

Folks, remember to squeeze out every last drop from _your_ experience!
