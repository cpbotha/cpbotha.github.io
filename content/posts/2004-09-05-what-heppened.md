Dear Readers,

My self-inflicted thesis deadline of the end of August whooshed by, slightly ruffling my alread ruffled hair in the process. One of the many good skills I picked up at [StoneThree Pty. Ltd.][1], may it become a huge company and may the people behind it become staggeringly rich, was to build &#8216;slop&#8217; into any schedule. &#8216;Slop&#8217; is extra time that comes in very handy when things take longer than you had planned. Like now.

I&#8217;m buring into my slop time at a terrifying pace. Fortunately I&#8217;m burning into the remaining pages of my thesis at a similarly terrifying pace. Unfortunately, the remaining pages of my thesis are monstrously bad-assed, so it&#8217;s a stressful race against time. Argh! It&#8217;s like some nail-biting edge-of-your-seat movie, except that it&#8217;s no fun at all.

So, that&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve been so quiet. I&#8217;ll let you know as soon as it&#8217;s done. A few months after that, I&#8217;ll get my License To Be An Utter Asshole. During the waiting period, I&#8217;ll be spending most of my time in the bar next door.
