See the <a href="http://visualisation.tudelft.nl/~cpbotha/thingies/dscas3register2d20031209.png" data-rel="lightbox-image-0" data-rl\_title="" data-rl\_caption="" title="">screenshot</a>. The code is just short of being awe-inspiringly horrible, but it works and is quite usable for automatic and semi-automatic rigid registration of 2D sections for 3D reconstruction.
