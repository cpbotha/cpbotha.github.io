Contrary to popular belief and idiot marketing droids, [Mark Shuttleworth][1] is technically _not_ the first African in space. This of course is dependent on your definition of &#8220;African&#8221;, but if that definition is &#8220;person born in Africa&#8221;, the title of First African in Space should go to Colonel Patrick Baudry, a French dude who was born in Douala, Cameroon on March 6, 1946. Colonel Baudry was part of the 1985 space shuttle Discovery crew.

Mark _is_ still the first Durbanvillite[1] in Space, and that&#8217;s something we can all be proud of.

To conclude this Shuttleworth special, it seems the man is a [big Python fan][2]. That does completely redeem him in my eyes.

[1] Northern suburb of Cape Town, quite snobbish in a middle-class sort of way.
