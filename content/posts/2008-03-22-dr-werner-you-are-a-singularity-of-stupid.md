We all know that homeopathy is really stupid, just like most alternative medicine. However, when I saw [this &#8220;lecture&#8221;][1] by Dr Charlene Werner, I was astounded by the depths of stupidity that she is able to attain. It&#8217;s almost like she&#8217;s a kind of Superheroine of Stupidity, with the special power of creating a singularity of stupid. This is of course stupidity that&#8217;s so extreme that it tends towards infinity and temporarily makes all reason disappear into a black-hole of scientific incompetence. Wow.

Bottom-line: if you have a brain-cell or two and you care about it, _stay very far away from homeopathy_. It will make you stupid too.

**Update**

They pulled that specific video from youtube, probably because they were concerned about Dr. Werner&#8217;s reputation going even more to the dogs than it already has (but not as much as it deserves). Fortunately, the video has been mirrored:
