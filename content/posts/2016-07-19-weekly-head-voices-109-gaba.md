  * From now on, I would like to limit WHVs to bullets (really) or to named sections, to ease reading. DOWN WITH WALLS OF TEXT!
  * After a multi-year, completely coincidental, break from **medical imaging**, I am back to _The Real Business_ since the start of July. I am super excited about the plans we&#8217;re cooking up and executing. I can obviously not say too much, unless beer is involved, or you hang around here for muuuuuch longer. I think I am allowed to mention **digital pathology** and **machine learning** and beer.
  * Last week we **road-tripped up the East Coast to [St Francis Bay][1]**, via Oudtshoorn and the [Cango Caves][2]. 
      * Pro tip: When road tripping with more than 0 (zero) children (babies count double; sick babies +5 hit points), and you have to stay overnight somewhere, invest extra in the biggest suite you (or your children&#8217;s college fund) can afford.
      * On the beach in St Francis Bay (right in the middle of winter, you still seem to get these lovely balmy beach days), it seemed that _everybody_ was surfing. Whole families, with the mom, the dad, all the kids, and grandma and grandpa, were all on various sizes of surfboards in the sea catching some waves.
      * Here&#8217;s a photo from the furthest point on what I call &#8220;Not The Ugliest Jogging Route in The World&#8221; (in St Francis Bay):

  * Last night I accidentally discovered that I can pinpoint the exact weekend and location when and where I first tasted my **favourite [trappist beer][3] (EVER)**, namely Rochefort #8. It&#8217;s all written up in [this 2003 post][4].
  * When Google send me an email this weekend asking me exactly _how_ I would like them to use my email (yes, a few months ago I migrated my mail empire back to Google because [my self-hosting experiment][5] had started to cost me time and money) to show me custom advertisements, I was reminded that I do actually find the machine learning models they&#8217;re building about me quite creepy, and that perhaps I would prefer not also handing them 12 years of emails to make their models more accurate. There and then **I migrated said 12 years of emails from GMail to [FastMail][6]**. So far I&#8217;m really impressed by the product, mostly due to the speed and the user experience of the web-app. There might be a more detailed post in the near future, let me know if you&#8217;re interested.
  * _Most surprising and interesting (to me) new scientific discovery of the week:_ A team of scientists at Northeastern University in Boston [have shown][7] that **one of the many kinds of bacteria living in your stomach eats exclusively [GABA][8]**, a really important brain chemical (neurotransmitter) that plays a role in keeping you calm. Based on this and other work, it looks like the bacteria in your tummy, also known as your [gastrointestinal microbiota][9], besides being crucially important to your digestive system and your general survival, probably also play quite an important role in your psyche. I find this slightly mind-blowing.

Have a great week kids, I hope to see you on the other side.

P.S. Those bullets made for quite an impressive wall of text, didn&#8217;t they?
