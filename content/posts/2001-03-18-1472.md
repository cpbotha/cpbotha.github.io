I almost bought an Olympus C990Z (US: D490Z) yesterday, but the stupid shop didn&#8217;t have any in stock and I didn&#8217;t feel like haggling about the display model. This seems like a very solid 2MP camera and if reviews can be believed, its only con is that it doesn&#8217;t have USB. At the moment it&#8217;s between this and the KODAK DC3400, which also seems like a good buy and is even a bit cheaper than the Olympus.
