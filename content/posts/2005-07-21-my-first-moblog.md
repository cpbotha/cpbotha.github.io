Now I can bore you to death by sending these senseless MMSes directly from my cellphone. procmail picks them up, passes them to moblog.py (a little script that I slapped together) which then parses the mails and posts them to my weblog via the xmlrpc interface.

Yes, I know moblogging was hip 3 years ago. I \*like\* being behind the times.
