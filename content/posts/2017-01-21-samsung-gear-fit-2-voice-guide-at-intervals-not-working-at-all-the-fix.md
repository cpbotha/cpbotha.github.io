**Update 2017-05-02:** _As reported by Kjetil in the comments, if you update the Health apps in the GEAR category of Galaxy Apps, this should fix the problem without having to change your phone&#8217;s language. I&#8217;m keeping the rest of the post here as a record of events._

This is a really short note to help other people trying to get their broken Samsung Gear Fit 2 voice &#8220;guide at intervals&#8221; to work.

In short, by activating the &#8220;guide at intervals&#8221; function on the Gear Fit 2, you can get a synthesised voice to give you all kinds of stats while you are running with bluetooth earphones. In my case, I set it up to give me distance, pacing and heart rate information every 0.5 km. This helps me to control my pace and extend my run.

After a recent phone swap, my Gear Fit 2 stopped giving me any kind of voice guidance. The music would continue playing, but at the first 0.5 km point when the voice guidance should have piped up, the watch would jump back to the watch face, instead of staying in the exercise app.

As seems to be par for the course with the Gear Fit 2, this was highly frustrating behaviour, with no help from the phone user interface or any of the Samsung documentation.

After some [to-and-fro on the Samsung forums][1], Dutch user BarryNLÂ came up with the answer.

It turns out that if the phone language is set to anything other than &#8220;English (US)&#8221;, the voice guidance seems to crash the running app, dumping you at the watch face during your run.

I switched my phone from &#8220;English (South African)&#8221; to &#8220;English (US)&#8221;, rebooted the phone, then rebooted the Gear Fit 2, and finally went out for a quick test walk.

Samsung Gear Fit 2 voice guide at intervals was back!

I am really happy to have this core feature back, and to have the exercise app stay active until the end of my run. However, this undocumented behaviour, as well as the fact that the watch, which has more than enough processing power and a beautiful display, does not give any kind of feedback to help the user correct the issue, makes for an extremely frustrating experience.
