Monday May 3 to Sunday May 10.

The PhD plan: 136 words per day for a year.

At the dinner table, we're having a conversatin with my 14 year old about
further education in general and about PhDs in particular.

I say that she will have to get a PhD in Physics and Math, but that I would be
able to live with a PhD in engineering.

She asks us how a PhD works, so we explain the background as well as we can.

We spend quite some time on the observation that the most important part of a
successful PhD is just never giving up, which usually includes an existential
crisis halfway through.

Talking more about the mechanics, she asks how big a PhD thesis usually is. Off the top of my head I say around 50 thousand words, but that there is huge variation.

(I checked later, mine was almost exatly 50k.)

She gets out her phone and makes a quick calculation, after which she quips:
"Well, that's easy. I'll spend one year planning, then I'll spend the year
after that writing only 136 words per day, and the year after that revising
everything to make it really good."
