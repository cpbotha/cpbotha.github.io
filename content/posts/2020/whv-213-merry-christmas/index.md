## Merry Christmas {#merry-christmas}

During this week, the most noteworthy happening was of course Christmas.

As a family, we are wholly dedicated to the pursuit and application of Love and
Science. However, we do try to respect the religious customs of our fellow
humans.

In the light of this, respectfully and retrospectively, I wish you all a very
merry christmas!

(I have to say that my kids really adore the gifting-aspect of this
particular celebration, if you get my drift.)


## Creativity, Inc. book notes published {#creativity-inc-dot-book-notes-published}

I finally got around to processing and publishing [my notes on the book
_Creativity, Inc._ by Ed Catmull](/2020/12/22/book-notes-creativity-inc/).

There are a number of great nuggets in there if you are at all interested to
learn about the care and feeding of sustainable creative organizations.

Even if that's not your cup of tea, being able to take a look inside a company
like Pixar is quite fascinating.

BTW, books are really cheap upgrades for your brain's operating system.

BTW, I'm planning more book notes.


## Body Budgets {#body-budgets}

On that topic, I have just started reading [Seven and a Half Lessons About the
Brain](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48930266-seven-and-a-half-lessons-about-the-brain) by psychologist and neuro-scientist Lisa Feldman Barrett, after listening
to another [super-entertaining podcast with her and Lex Fridman](https://lexfridman.com/lisa-feldman-barrett/).

I am planning to write much more about her ideas, but for now I would like to
plant this memetic seed:

[Our big brains evolved to manage our body budgets](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/23/opinion/brain-neuroscience-stress.html).

In short, managing the metabolic needs of a whole human is tremendously
complicated.

Throughout the day (every day), that big super-computer in your head is
calculating a million inputs and outputs to ensure your survival, and more
importantly, the survival of your genetic material.

To me, a truly interesting aspect of this is that social interaction is just
another, albeit important, variable in this complicated system of equations.

One of the implications of this realization is that social interaction requires
a substantial amount of metabolic energy, an equation your brain will apply
quite strictly.

If you're getting low on energy, your brain could very well cancel that kind
interaction you were planning, instead substituting with a quick eject, because
it predicts (the brain is a fabulous prediction machine, you'll see much more
of that here in the coming months) that you'll probably run out of energy a bit
later.

Related to what [I wrote last week concerning the use-it-or-lose-it principle](/2020/12/23/weekly-head-voices-212-use-it-or-lose-it/#use-it-or-lose-it),
this is yet another reason to invest in one's physiology and its energy
efficiency:

_Your body needs energy to be nice._
