Guided by the ["keystroke megaphone"
principle](/2014/06/10/weekly-head-voices-73-keystroke-megaphone/#conserving-keystrokes),
I decided to post this email reply I just sent.

An anonymous reader emailed me the following question:

> Is it possible to use machine learning or algorithms in a campaign or in an
> electoral process?

I wrote the following reply:

Have I mentioned that I sometimes think about doing a startup that employs all
of the above techniques and more *For Good&trade;*, where with *For Good&trade;*
I mean for all ideas that align with *my* perfect worldview?

P.S. [Fake news is just the beginning,
2017.](https://cpbotha.net/2017/03/25/fake-news-is-just-the-beginning/) is
quite relevant.
