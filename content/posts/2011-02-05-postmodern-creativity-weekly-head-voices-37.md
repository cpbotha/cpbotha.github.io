_Post summary: Review humour, WhatsApp, SPA3102 gadget, hiking boots, happiness in the blue zones._

So there are people on the internets who have chosen as their creative outlet the writing of superbly entertaining fictitious reviews of real products on real e-commerce sites. See for example this customer review of a tub of uranium ore that was once available on Amazon:<figure id="attachment_1188" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1188" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://cpbotha.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/frikkin\_uranium\_2.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-image-0" data-rl\_title="" data-rl\_caption="" title="">

<img data-attachment-id="1188" data-permalink="https://cpbotha.net/2011/02/05/postmodern-creativity-weekly-head-voices-37/frikkin_uranium_2/" data-orig-file="https://cpbotha.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/frikkin_uranium_2.jpg" data-orig-size="500,374" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="frikkin_uranium_2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://cpbotha.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/frikkin_uranium_2-300x224.jpg" data-large-file="https://cpbotha.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/frikkin_uranium_2.jpg" class="size-medium wp-image-1188" title="frikkin_uranium_2" src="http://cpbotha.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/frikkin_uranium_2-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" srcset="https://cpbotha.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/frikkin_uranium_2-300x224.jpg 300w, https://cpbotha.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/frikkin_uranium_2.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 85vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1188" class="wp-caption-text">You used to be able to buy uranium ore on amazon.

For more examples, please do see [this article on Cracked.com][1]. What a fantastic creative medium! One day, when I grow up, I too shall spend time honing my review writing skills.

Because I&#8217;ve _just_ realised that this post was never going to be more than a mishmash of odd but hopefully interesting tidbits, I shall now switch to bullet-list mode:

  * I&#8217;ve slowly started developing principles against sending texts (SMS), purely because I think the telephone companies are charging way too much for these 160 character micro-messages. Even if you do have a great big SMS bundle, usually when you text overseas, you still get whacked.Â [**WhatsApp**][2] does a pretty good job at being a texting substitute: It runs in the background on Nokia, Android, iPhone or Blackberry smartphones, and allows one to **send and receive unlimited SMS-like messages** via one&#8217;s dataplan to other WhatsApp users. Just like texting, it only requires telephone numbers, so directly after installation, one sees a list of all one&#8217;s WhatsApp-running contacts (from the phone&#8217;s database). Big advantage over for example BlackBerry BBM (ping) is that WhatsApp runs on many more telephones. In short: Try it, you might like it!
  * On the theme of sticking it to the man (and when I say &#8220;man&#8221; I mean &#8220;telephone company&#8221;), I recently acquired a [**Cisco SPA3102 Voice Gateway**][3] (used to be Sipura, then Linksys). It&#8217;s a tiny little box that sits in-between your broadband connection (ADSL or cable modem) and house telephone and, if configured correctly, routes all telephone calls via SIP (voice-over-ip) providers. In short: Seriously cheap phone calls via internet, telephone company never even sees you and hence can&#8217;t really bill you. The only problem is that this little box has the most complex configuration interface I&#8217;ve ever seen. There must be at least a few hundred configuration settings, and if you get any one of them wrong, your phone system simply stops working. I&#8217;ve written up what you need to know at my [Even Nerdier Blog][4].
  * What&#8217;s the deal with **hiking boots and engineers**? Hiking boots are great for hiking, but wearing them to work (or far worse, to a social event) must be _the_ most extreme way of showing your asymptotic support of function over form. I have to admit that I myself have sinned before, but usually I have a good excuse, such as that storm outside. There are some people however (and the matching hiking boots worn by in-love engineers / nerds are the absolute worst) that don&#8217;t seem to understand that form and function do need to be in some form of balance for the world to function and for me to maintain my non-nauseous state.
  * It is important to note that Timberland boots strike this balance just perfectly, as you can see below:<figure id="attachment_1089" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1089" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://cpbotha.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/timberland.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-image-1" data-rl\_title="" data-rl\_caption="" title="">

<img data-attachment-id="1089" data-permalink="https://cpbotha.net/2010/09/12/time-does-wait-for-electronic-true-love-weekly-head-voices-30/timberland/" data-orig-file="https://cpbotha.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/timberland.jpg" data-orig-size="450,336" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="timberland" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://cpbotha.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/timberland-300x224.jpg" data-large-file="https://cpbotha.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/timberland.jpg" class="size-medium wp-image-1089" title="timberland" src="http://cpbotha.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/timberland-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" srcset="https://cpbotha.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/timberland-300x224.jpg 300w, https://cpbotha.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/timberland.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 85vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1089" class="wp-caption-text">This is what form and function look like when they're in perfect balance.</figcaption></figure> 

To conclude this post, I&#8217;d like to summarise a [lifehacker summary][5] of Dan Buettner&#8217;s [book][6] on the factors that play a role in the happiness of people living in the world&#8217;s &#8220;blue zones&#8221; (countries / regions where people live long and contented lives): 1. work less, 2. keep your commute as short as possible, 3. have regular vacations, 4. socialise with your colleagues and finally, 5. make sure you work for a good boss.

No big surprises there, but sometimes it&#8217;s nice being reminded of the stuff we should never have forgotten in the first place.
