I attended another shoulder replacement: this time a full replacement lasting a good 5 to 5.5 hours performed by the same skilled surgeon as the previous time. Very educational, with a relocation of the teres major and latissimus dorsi thrown in for good measure.

I have also decided to take a more relaxed approach by returning to level-set and fast-marching methods and dscas1 development: I&#8217;ve been spending lots of time on and getting all stressed up about some crackpot neural system ideas that I had. Thus, no Nobel prize this year.

BTW, that kernel patch is now in the ac kernels and should filter through to the main kernel tree at some stage.
