This is what we thought up and constructed for dinner last night&#8230; it was divine. Thanks to [Paul][1] for suggesting the pancetta, it&#8217;s perfect for this dish.

Ingredients:

  * one aubergine per person 
      * one ball of fresh mozzarella per 2 persons 
          * 60 g of pancetta per person (amazing italian bacon, you&#8217;ll have to get this from your deli) 
              * chestnut mushrooms (I think this is what they&#8217;re called; in Dutch they&#8217;re called &#8220;kastanje champignons&#8221;) &#8211; obviously you can improvise if you can&#8217;t find these 
                  * onions 
                      * italian spices (oreganum, dried basil, etc), salt, freshly ground black pepper 
                          * basil pesto 
                              * rucola (aka rocket salad) 
                                  * fresh tomatoes 
                                      * fresh focaccia or other rough bread </ul> 
                                        Recipe:
                                        
                                          * cut the aubergines into 1cm thick slices 
                                              * sprinkle with salt on both sides, allow to drain for 10 to 15 minutes 
                                                  * whilst the aubergine slices are draining, lightly fry the chopped mushrooms and onions in good olive oil, season with spices, salt and pepper 
                                                      * put the mushrooms and onions in a bowl when done 
                                                          * lightly fry the pancetta in olive oil, remove when done 
                                                              * fry the drained aubergine slices until they&#8217;re browned on both sides (and tasty!) &#8211; don&#8217;t be shy with the olive oil 
                                                                  * on some tin foil, build little towers consisting of a layer of aubergine, some mushrooms and onion, some pancetta, another layer of aubergine, etc. End with mushrooms and onions as the top layer 
                                                                      * put your aubergine building complex under the grill (200 degrees celsius or something) for 15 to 30 minutes, or until you feel that enough grilling has taken place :) 
                                                                          * during the last 4 or 5 minutes of grilling, top each aubergine tower with a slice of the fresh mozzarella and a teaspoon (or more) of pesto; season generously with spices, salt and pepper &#8211; the cheese will melt and the cheese and pesto will form a lovely mixture slowly oozing down (hmmmm) 
                                                                              * make a bed of rucola leaves and fresh sliced tomato in a plate 
                                                                                  * install your aubergine towers on this bed 
                                                                                      * serve with focaccia </ul>
