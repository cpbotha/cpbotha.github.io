This is my links page, mostly reserved for static things I think are interesting.Â  For dynamic stuff (such as blogs), check the right sidebar for my Google Reader exported items.

  * [De Wijn Recensent][1] &#8211; my best friend (I have more than one. They are a small but very powerful group of shadowy individuals) is the only Dutch wine reviewer that you can trust. You have to subscribe to his weekly reviews on [the site][2]!
  * [Selecxyz][4] &#8211; good friends of mine can link you up with a perfect little villa for your holiday in Italy.
