# Tips

The extension is free, but tips are greatly appreciated!

30% of what you donate will go to a local South African charity. I tend to choose ones with an educational theme.

The rest will go towards my (expensive) coffee habit and the yearly Apple Developer subscription I now need to keep this extension alive.

## Paypal with 4 easy options:

## Paypal with an amount of your choosing:

## Ethereum address

TBD. Mail me if you need this, which will expedite the process of me putting the address up here.

# Top contributors

None so far.

# Charities contributed to

From this app, none.

# Planned improvements

  * Improve algorithm that matches Apple Music tracks to Spotify tracks. It&#8217;s now quite rigid, and hence sometimes misses songs it could have matched. </ul>
