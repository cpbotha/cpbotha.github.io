This page will always link to my latest blog post with VTK Windows binaries, so you know you have the most recent ones.Â  The latest post is:

  * [Python 2.6 enabled VTK 5.4 Windows binaries][1]

You might still be interested in the older Python 2.5 builds:

  * [Python 2.5 enabled VTK 5.4 Windows binaries.][2]

However, if you&#8217;re really serious about VTK, ITK and perhaps even a kitchen sink, and you would like the choice between 32bit and 64bit on both Windows and Linux, you should really be looking at the [DeVIDE Runtime Environment, or DRE][3].
