My personal blog has existed in some form or another since at least May 27, 2001.  See the [first LiveJournal post][1], or its [ported version][2] on this blog.  I seem to remember that I had some form of a blog _before_ that (it&#8217;s alluded to in the post, plus that the internet wayback machine believes I blogged from the url http:/cpbotha.net/cgi-bin/weblog before my livejournal phase), but my old brain simply refuses giving up more information.  If you know more, please contact me. :)
