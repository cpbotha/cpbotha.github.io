My personal _blog_ has existed in some form or another since at least February
27, 2001.

You can't see the [first LiveJournal post][1] from May 2001 anymore, but you
can see its [ported version][2] on this blog.

It seems that [I was using Blogger](https://cpbotha.blogspot.com/) before
that - I've recovered some of those posts and ported them here. See [the
February 27, 2001 post here](/2001/02/27/1469/).

Wayback Machine has snapshots of this site going as far back as [November 27,
1999](https://web.archive.org/web/19991127081129/http://www.cpbotha.net/). It
looks like I embedded the blogger feed on my site as
[http://cpbotha.net/cgi-bin/weblog](https://web.archive.org/web/20010424061144/http://cpbotha.net/cgi-bin/weblog).

After the blogger / LJ era, the blog spent some time as a Movable Type
instance, then got on board the WordPress train shortly after it was
introduced in 2003, and more recently [it became a static site again, this
time using Hugo](/2019/03/31/wordpress-to-hugo/).
