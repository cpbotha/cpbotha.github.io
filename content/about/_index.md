This is [my](http://charlbotha.com) personal blog.

You will find posts on science, software, general nerdery, privacy and
[backyard philosophy](/tags/backyard-philosophy/). It also hosts [the Weekly
Head Voices](/categories/weekly-head-voices/), a weekly (mostly not) personal
diary, in which I usually also try to include something entertaining and/or
educational.

My **personal, non-work e-mail** address is [cpbotha@cpbotha.net][2], although
I much prefer if you leave a comment on the relevant blog post.

_(This blog is so old, it even has a [history page][3].)_

## GitHub mirror

Starting in September of 2021, most of this blog's contents (hundreds of posts
spread out over 20 years of life) should be mirrored on
[github](https://github.com/cpbotha/cpbotha.net) in the source markdown format.

You can read more about why and how in [WHV
#232](/2021/09/13/weekly-head-voices-232-side-project-smorgasbord/#this-blog-hopefully-immortalised-on-github).
