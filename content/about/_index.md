This is [my](http://charlbotha.com) personal blog.

You will find posts on science, software, general nerdery, privacy and
[backyard philosophy](/tags/backyard-philosophy/). It also hosts [the Weekly
Head Voices](/categories/weekly-head-voices/), a weekly (mostly not) personal
diary, in which I usually also try to include something entertaining and/or
educational.

My **personal, non-work e-mail** address is [cpbotha@cpbotha.net][2], although
I much prefer if you leave a comment on the relevant blog post.

_(This blog is so old, it even has a [history page][3].)_
