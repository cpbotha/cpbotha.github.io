This site is all about me, me and me. To be more precise, the private, non-work me.  Sometimes, there&#8217;s a bit of cross-talk between work-me and private-me, but I try to keep these two apart as far as possible.  Hence the voices.  The voices!!

If you&#8217;d like to meet some of the other MEs, also the more work-inclined ones, feel free to visit [charlbotha.com][1].

My **personal, non-work e-mail** address is [cpbotha@cpbotha.net][2], although I much prefer if you leave a comment on the relevant blog post.

_(This blog is so old, it even has a [history page][3].)_
