I use many abbreviations in the Weekly Head Voices, mostly to indicate people.  This page contains a handy summary.

  * ERCI &#8211; [extremely resourceful  / capable individual][1]
  * FNSF &#8211; French Neuro-Scientist Friend
  * HVR &#8211; Head Voices Review
  * SO &#8211; Significant Other
  * TNR &#8211; [The New Roomie][2]
  * TPN &#8211; [Tall Philosophical Neighbour][3]
  * WHV-NI &#8211; [Weekly Head Voices Nerd Index][4]
