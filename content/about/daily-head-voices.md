Read [the "Writing" section of the 2023 to 2024 transition post](/2024/01/04/the-2023-to-2024-transition-post/#writing) for the slightly more detailed origin story of the daily head voices.

In short: Starting on November 14, 2023, first on [the emacs.ch Mastodon server](https://emacs.ch/@cpbotha) and from December 18 right here on this blog, I publish **a low expectations daily bullet list of life minutiae**: *Experiences, learnings and observations that might be interesting to Someone on the Internet.*

You can find all of the DHV / lifelog posts, or even subscribe exclusively to their RSS, under the [lifelog post category](/categories/lifelog/).
