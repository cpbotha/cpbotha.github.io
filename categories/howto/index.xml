To make a long and interesting story short, srcset enables us to tell the browser that we have for example 5 different resolutions of an image available, and that it should choose the best one based on the user&amp;rsquo;s device.
Pretty neat actually!

Hugo</a>
slightly more than a year ago, I started using <a href="https://laurakalbag.com/processing-responsive-images-with-hugo/">Laura Kalbag&rsquo;s special <code>img</code>
shortcode</a>
with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia%5Fand%5Fembedding/Responsive%5Fimages">img srcset
support</a>.</p>
<p>To make a long and interesting story short, <code>srcset</code> enables us to tell the
browser that we have for example 5 different resolutions of an image available,
and that it should choose the best one based on the user&rsquo;s device.</p>
<p>Pretty neat actually!</p>
<p>Anyways, I tweaked the code a bit over time, and most recently I combined it
with the stock Hugo <code>figure</code> shortcode.</p>
<p>What this means, is that you can now use just the straight <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#figure">Hugo <code>figure</code>
shortcode as per the
documentation</a>, and my
modified shortcode will do all of image processing and srcset specification
fully automatically.</p>
<p>In other words, you only have to refer to your fullest resolution image in the
figure shortcode, and hugo will take care of creating a number of downscaled
versions, and offer them to modern browsers in a way that gives the user the
best experience.</p>
<h2 id="install-and-use">Install and use</h2>
<p>To install, simply download <a href="https://gist.github.com/cpbotha/deb310eed14308fe26f7b7d0fabeb34d">the figure.html
gist</a>
(embedded below) into the <code>layouts/shortcodes</code> directory in your hugo blog and
then rebuild your blog.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> It&rsquo;s <strong>very</strong> important that images have to be in <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/">the page
bundle</a> if you want
automatic resizing and srcset. The shortcode will fall back to stock Hugo
behaviour otherwise.</p>
<script type="application/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/cpbotha/deb310eed14308fe26f7b7d0fabeb34d.js"></script>

<h2 id="example-result">Example result</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve posted the image below so you can see the shortcode in action.</p>
<p>It started as <code>{{&lt; figure src=&quot;20200324_stillbaai_beach.jpg&quot; link=&quot;20200324_stillbaai_beach.jpg&quot; caption=&quot;...&quot; &gt;}}</code> and ended up as the
image below.</p>
<p>If you right click, and then inspect, you&rsquo;ll see the <code>srcset</code>
specification. Even better if you switch to the network panel in devtools, then
reload, and note that your browser downloads a lower resolution image if you&rsquo;ve
narrowed your viewport, or switched devtools to mobile emulation.</p>

<h2 id="updates">Updates</h2>
<ul>
<li>On 2020-05-10 I updated the shortcode to fall back to stock Hugo behaviour
instead of just breaking when the image was not part of the page
bundle. However, if you want resizing and srcset (the whole point of this
post), your images should be in the page bundle. :)</li>

<p>Here I single out three of the tweets, but you should really read the whole
thread:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When coding, I always maintain a journal in the repo (I happen to use Markdeep
for this now) with a TODO list.</p>
<p>Tasks are at the level of one hour for &ldquo;today&rdquo; stuff, one day for next week,
and then week- or longer level tasks.</p>
<p>I expand the details for the next week on Friday.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tweet 3:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I start working on the top, ~1-hour item, on the list, I immediately
expand it recursively until the subtasks are completely braindead to
implement.</p>
<p>I do all of the hard part of programming here, in the TODO list, figuring out
the library calls, designing the APIs, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tweet 4:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I get into the actual source code, I&rsquo;m just working from my own
walk-through on the TODO list, and I only need to think about syntax and code
cleanup. I can focus on programming legibly in the small instead of worrying
about the big picture.</p>

<p>This is such a brilliant way of doing the highest level &ldquo;programming&rdquo; in an
outlining tool, and then working one&rsquo;s way down until it&rsquo;s eventually time to
jump into the code.</p>
<p>I can also immediately see how well this would work in a team context.</p>
<p>During the planning session, the outline could be collaboratively fleshed
out. Furthermore, as McGuire states, it can be fleshed out differently
depending on the experience level of the team member.</p>
<p>This makes me wonder how much we as engineers <em>really</em> need the Jiras and the
YouTracks and the DevOpses of the world?</p>
<p>(Just joking folks, I know we need it, but perhaps we could do with a little
more MMMMM in our lives?)</p>
<h2 id="markdeep">Markdeep.</h2>
<p>Almost in passing McGuire mentions markdeep, the system he designed for
extremely agile technical documentation.</p>
<p>A friend from work introduced me to this years ago (thanks HB!), but then I
somehow missed its genius.</p>
<p>One of the core ideas that makes markdeep so interesting and useful, is that
the markdeep plaintext markup (it&rsquo;s like supercharged markdown) is embedded in
an extremely thin layer of HTML which invokes the markdeep.js renderer on
itself.</p>
<p>In other words, you edit the self-contained <code>.md.html</code> file with your favourite
text editor, but when you open this file in your browser, a single line of HTML
at the end pulls in <code>markdeep.min.js</code> from a CDN or from your local disc, and
renders the beautifully typeset version of the document.</p>
<p>As if that was not enough, markdeep has extensive support for the SVG rendering
of ascii art.</p>
<p>See the following pages for more information:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/">The Markdeep website</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/features.md.html">The extensive Markdeep demo
document</a> - especially
the <a href="https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/features.md.html#diagramexamples">diagram
examples</a>
are impressive!</li>
</ul>
<p>For my own notes I am sticking to <a href="https://orgmode.org/">Orgmode</a> (if you&rsquo;re an
emacs user, it&rsquo;s more powerful), but there will surely be situations where the
self-contained Markdeep makes more sense.</p>
<h2 id="the-graphics-codex">The Graphics Codex.</h2>
<p>Markdeep has been used to author a number of books, but <a href="http://graphicscodex.com/">The Graphics
Codex</a> must be one of the more amazing examples, in
terms of its interactivity and just general prettiness.</p>
<p>The iPhone app version looks like this:</p>

<p>I triggered the built-in export-functionality in the Disqus admin interface.</p>
<p>The site then shows a message that it will email you when the export is ready.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s now 24 hours later and that email never came&hellip;</p>
<p>(I retried at least 3 times. I even <a href="https://twitter.com/cvoxel/status/1193181451002482690">tweeted at
them</a>, because there&rsquo;s
no other way to contact support.)</p>
<p>When you read the fineprint on <a href="https://help.disqus.com/en/articles/1717199-importing-exporting#exporting-from-disqus">the relevant help
page</a>,
you see the following (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please note: exports <strong>may not be available for all sites</strong>, particularly
those of a large size. If you&rsquo;ve requested an export file more than twice and
still have not received a download link from us, it&rsquo;s likely that an export
for your site is <strong>currently unavailable</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So that&rsquo;s pretty reassuring! You <em>might</em> get an export. It depends&hellip; Whatever
the case may be, you <em>won&rsquo;t</em> get any sort of feedback however.</p>
<p>I guess this is an issue with any hosted solution.</p>
<p>However, one would expect from any such service that advertises the possibility
to export one&rsquo;s <em>own data</em>, even on the free tier, that one is in fact
<em>allowed</em> to export one&rsquo;s own data.</p>
<p>NOT IN DISQUS WORLD!</p>
<p>Anyways, I was not going to let this highly disappointing performance stop my
migration efforts.</p>
<h2 id="enter-isso">Enter isso!</h2>
<p>After discovering that the open-source self-hosted <a href="https://gitlab.com/commento/commento">commento
software</a> requires at least Postgres 9.5
but webfaction (my webhoster for years and years now, unfortunately our ways
will probably have to part thanks to the godaddy acquisition) is stuck at
Postgres 9.4, I decided to configure isso, the same <a href="https://vxlabs.com/2019/04/06/isso-on-webfaction/">commenting system I have
running on vxlabs</a>.</p>
<h3 id="new-feature-auto-approve-previously-approved-authors">New feature: Auto-approve previously approved authors.</h3>
<p>However, to make it a little more interesting, I decided to implement an
auto-moderation feature in isso that I used to use in all my wordpress
installations:</p>
<p><em>Auto-approve authors who have had comments approved in the past N months</em>.</p>
<p>Long story short, you can find my work in <a href="https://github.com/cpbotha/isso/commits/cpbotha-auto-moderate-known-authors">this github fork of
isso</a>.</p>
<p>I will soon create a PR into the main repo. It might or might not get accepted.</p>
<p>Simply edit the <code>moderation</code> section of your <code>isso.cfg</code> to look something like
the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#586e75;background-color:#eee8d5;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ini" data-lang="ini"><span style="color:#859900">[moderation]</span>
<span style="color:#268bd2">enabled</span> = <span style="color:#2aa198">true</span>
<span style="color:#268bd2">activate-if-email-previously-approved</span> = <span style="color:#2aa198">true</span>
</code></pre></div><p>When someone leaves a comment, and their email address has had a comment
approved within the last 6 months, the new comment will be automatically
activated.</p>
<p>The advantage of this feature is that comment-conversations can happen much
more fluidly, without me having to approve each and every comment that comes
in.</p>
<h3 id="migrating-comments-in-spite-of-disqus">Migrating comments in spite of Disqus.</h3>
<p>In NormalWorld, I would have exported an XML from Disqus, and just imported
that into isso using the built-in functionality.</p>
<p>However, in DisqusWorld, the user has to suffer.</p>
<p>Fortunately I could import the bulk of the old comments (up to March of this
year) using the old Wordpress site export and isso&rsquo;s great import function.</p>
<p>For the remaining 25 comments, I manually copied each and every one of them,
along with author name, email (if I knew it) and exact date, and then inserted
them manually into the isso sqlite database, using the amazing
<a href="https://sqlitebrowser.org/">sqlitebrowser</a>.</p>
<p>I discovered three possibly useful facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the <code>parent</code> column in a <code>comment</code> record is not set explicitly to <code>NULL</code>
in the case of no parent, the comment does not show up.</li>
<li>Isso supports only one level of nesting in the database. This means the
<code>parent</code> column has to point to a root, i.e. parent-less, comment.</li>
<li>Isso stores timestamps as seconds since epoch. You can use the following SQL
to convert a timestring to seconds since epoch:</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#586e75;background-color:#eee8d5;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql"><span style="color:#859900">select</span> <span style="color:#268bd2">strftime</span>(<span style="color:#2aa198">&#34;%s&#34;</span>, <span style="color:#2aa198">&#34;2019-08-22 14:11&#34;</span>);
</code></pre></div><p>I was up until 01:00 getting all of this running smoothly.</p>
<p>That is how much I love this blog and its people. :D</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions.</h2>
<p>I am happy that all of your comments are now self-hosted on this server using
open-source software that I have a good grasp of.</p>
<p>I am happy that your valuable thoughts are backed up each and every night.</p>
<p>You should also notice that pages load much faster (disqus is quite slow).</p>
<p>(Also: MARKDOWN!)</p>
<p>Ok folks, I hope this further diminishes any barriers that there might have
been to you leaving us a message now and then!</p>

<p>Even if you&rsquo;re not planning to use Emacs for this, it might be interesting

<h2 id="the-importance-of-habits">The importance of habits.</h2>
<p>If you have some experience being, you know, alive, and perhaps even trying to
get just that little bit better at it every day, you will have realised by now
that being able to form and maintain good habits is almost a super power.</p>
<p>(Other real-life super powers: Kindness. Peace. Focus. I digress&hellip; haha.)</p>
<p>All of those promises we make to ourselves to read more, to eat better, to
exercise more, to meditate regularly, and so on: The key to making all of these
happen is forming and then maintaining habits.</p>
<p>First the habit has to be created out of nothing, and once it&rsquo;s up and running,
the idea is to keep going at it for as long as possible.</p>
<p><a href="/2019/09/09/weekly-head-voices-177-streakers/#life-optimisation-tip-73-streak-more">Streaking</a>,
that is trying to continue for as long as possible without any interruption, is
a fun and effective trick to keep at it.</p>
<p>However, it is just as important being able to restart a new streak once the
previous one has been broken for whatever reason.</p>
<h2 id="what-the-orgmode-habit-tracker-does">What the Orgmode habit tracker does.</h2>
<p>Up to now, I mostly used <a href="/2019/09/21/note-taking-strategy-2019/#monthly-journal-files">daily checklists to keep track of healthy
habits</a>, but for
some habits, especially ones with a non-daily frequency, this does not work so
well.</p>
<p>A significant step up from daily checklists, the <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Tracking-your-habits.html">Emacs Orgmode habits
function</a> enables you:</p>
<ul>
<li>to specify any number of habits, each with different, sometimes less regular
frequencies;</li>
<li>to track when you perform a habit and when you should next perform it and finally</li>
<li>to visualize if you are performing according to the specifications you have
set.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example: I would like to run at least three times a week. There should be
at least one rest day after a running day (I&rsquo;m not a spring chicken
anymore). There should be a maximum of three rest days allowed (this usually
happens after a longer weekend run).</p>
<p>Although I enjoy running enough to keep this habit up by myself, I chose it as
a first test of the Orgmode habits function.</p>
<p>So far I have setup two other simpler examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>A core exercise which I call &ldquo;The Wheel&rdquo; (of pain). This has to happen every
second day, usually in between running days.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Deep reading&rdquo;, which is meant to describe a session of focused reading of
long-form, i.e. mostly books. This has to happen every day.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before starting tracking of these latter two habits slightly more than a week
ago, I somehow kept on letting them slip.</p>
<p>This morning, my org-agenda looked like this:</p>

<p>In the figure you can see that today, represented by the exclamation mark <code>!</code>,
I will have to schedule in a session of deep reading (indicated by the yellow
colouring), and a session of &ldquo;the wheel&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The running habit graph  is showing that I still have three days, including
today, on which I do not have to run.</p>
<p>By default it would not have displayed today, because I ran yesterday, as shown
by the asterisk <code>*</code>, and I specified that minimum of one rest day. However, I
temporarily configured it to show today for the sake of this exposition.</p>
<p>To summarise: These habit graphs show up as part of your org-agenda view and
show you at a glance when you should perform which habits, and, quite
importantly, how long you have been streaking a particular habit.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-setup-orgmode-habits">How to setup Orgmode habits.</h2>
<h3 id="global-configuration">Global configuration.</h3>
<p>Firstly, ensure that the <code>org-habit</code> Orgmode extension is activated by adding
the following to your <code>init.el</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#586e75;background-color:#eee8d5;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-elisp" data-lang="elisp">(<span style="color:#268bd2">add-to-list</span> <span style="color:#2aa198">&#39;org-modules</span> <span style="color:#2aa198">&#39;org-habit</span> <span style="color:#268bd2">t</span>)
</code></pre></div><p>Whilst your in your <code>init.el</code>, add something like the following to activate
state logging for the task <code>DONE</code> state:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#586e75;background-color:#eee8d5;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-elisp" data-lang="elisp"><span style="color:#93a1a1;font-style:italic">;; each state with ! is recorded as state change</span>
<span style="color:#93a1a1;font-style:italic">;; in this case I&#39;m logging TODO and DONE states</span>
(<span style="color:#cb4b16">setq</span> <span style="color:#268bd2">org-todo-keywords</span>
      &#39;((<span style="color:#268bd2">sequence</span> <span style="color:#2aa198">&#34;TODO(t!)&#34;</span> <span style="color:#2aa198">&#34;NEXT(n)&#34;</span> <span style="color:#2aa198">&#34;SOMD(s)&#34;</span> <span style="color:#2aa198">&#34;WAFO(w)&#34;</span> <span style="color:#2aa198">&#34;|&#34;</span> <span style="color:#2aa198">&#34;DONE(d!)&#34;</span> <span style="color:#2aa198">&#34;CANC(c!)&#34;</span>)))
<span style="color:#93a1a1;font-style:italic">;; I prefer to log TODO creation also</span>
(<span style="color:#cb4b16">setq</span> <span style="color:#268bd2">org-treat-insert-todo-heading-as-state-change</span> <span style="color:#268bd2">t</span>)
<span style="color:#93a1a1;font-style:italic">;; log into LOGBOOK drawer</span>

</code></pre></div><h3 id="per-habit-configuration">Per-habit configuration.</h3>
<p>Then, start creating the special habit nodes as explained in the following:</p>
<p>Below is what the &ldquo;running&rdquo; habit currently looks like in my <a href="/2019/09/21/note-taking-strategy-2019/#monthly-journal-files">current monthly

<span style="color: #7F9F7F;">:END:</span>
</pre>
<p>The <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Tracking-your-habits.html">orgmode habits
documentation</a> explains
that a habit is a special sort of <code>TODO</code> node with the following additional
properties, which can all be seen in the above example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The node has a <code>:STYLE:</code> property of <code>habit</code>. Configure with =M-x
org-set-property=.</li>
<li>The node has a <code>SCHEDULED</code> date in the future on the next date when this
habit should take place, along with a frequency / time constraint
specification, in this case <code>.+2d/4d</code>, meaning that at the most every second
day, and at the least every fourth day.</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, with <code>DONE</code> state logging configured as explained above, you&rsquo;ll
get the <code>LOGBOOK</code> with the required state changes used by the habit graphs.</p>
<h3 id="in-use">In use.</h3>
<p>Whenever you&rsquo;ve completed a habit, fire up Emacs (I&rsquo;m joking of course: Emacs
is always running) and then toggle the state of the habit to <code>DONE</code>.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see that it briefly toggles to <code>DONE</code>, and then automatically switches
back to <code>TODO</code>.</p>
<p>(There&rsquo;s some philosophical lesson to be learned from that&hellip;)</p>
<p>When this happens, the <code>:LAST_REPEAT:</code> timestamp will be automatically updated
to the current time, and, more importantly, the <code>SCHEDULED</code> date will be
automatically updated to the next earliest date when this habit should be
exercised.</p>
<p>In the case of the running example above, that will be tomorrow, as today is a
rest day.</p>
<p>Whenever you activate org-agenda, you&rsquo;ll see the habit graphs right at the top,
by default only on the days when they are actually scheduled. In the running
example, that habit will not appear on rest days. (This can naturally be
configured, see <code>M-x describe-variable RET org-habit-show-all-today</code>).</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion.</h2>
<ul>
<li>Being able to forming and maintain habits can form an important component of
better living.</li>
<li><em>Habit streaking</em> is a fun psychological trick to keep you going.</li>
<li>However, don&rsquo;t be disheartened by a broken streak. Get back on that horse and
try again.</li>
<li>Emacs Orgmode habit tracking is a great tool for Emacs users to help form and
maintain habits, especially non-daily ones.</li>

posts titled &ldquo;Moving M years of K from Y to Z&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As can be seen in the <a href="/about/history/">history page</a> or rather the <a href="/2001/02/27/1469/">first
weblog entry dated 2001-02-27</a>, this blog has been around
for more than 18 years.</p>
<p>It started as some CGI script, then spent some time as a LiveJournal, then,
thanks to meeting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriella_Coleman">Professor Biella
Coleman</a> who was at that
point still a grad student, went through a Movable Type phase and then, at
some point, converted to Wordpress.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know when exactly the Wordpress stage started, but it&rsquo;s probably not
too long after Wordpress was born in 2003 somewhere.</p>
<p>Anyways, after many happy years together, our ways are parting.</p>
<p>The new block-based editor in Wordpress 5, <a href="/tags/gutenberg/">Gutenberg</a>,
caters more for Wordpress as a CMS, and far less for Wordpress as a platform
for long-form blogging.</p>
<p>Personally I have noticed that the new editor gets in my way most of the time,
where the pre-Gutenberg editor worked just perfectly, for my use case.</p>
<p>Because life is short, and many more blog posts have to written, I made the
decision, not easily, to move this blog away from Wordpress, to a different
and hopefully more suitable platform.</p>
<p>I ended up choosing Hugo because its native mode of operation involves me
writing posts in some form of text editor, which is my preferred modality in
any case, but primarily because of all the static generators, it was the only
one with a prominent <a href="https://ox-hugo.scripter.co">Emacs Orgmode plugin</a>.</p>
<p>(Based on what I now know about Hugo, it looks like once again Emacs Orgmode
helped me make the best decision.)</p>
<p>In the rest of this post I describe the process of migrating the blog you see
before you from Wordpress to Hugo.</p>
<h2 id="export-data-from-wordpress">Export data from Wordpress.</h2>
<p>I used <a href="https://github.com/SchumacherFM/wordpress-to-hugo-exporter">SchumacherFM&rsquo;s
wordpress-to-hugo-exporter</a>
to export my whole wordpress site to a Hugo-compatible project.</p>
<p>Following(ish) <a href="https://github.com/SchumacherFM/wordpress-to-hugo-exporter#usage-with-a-self-hosted-wordpress-installation">the
instructions</a>,
I git cloned the <code>wordpress-to-hugo-exporter</code> into the <code>wp-content/plugins</code>
folder of the relevant wordpress installation, and then I invoked the export
script with <code>php hugo-export-cli.php</code>.</p>
<p>The end-result was a 600MB <code>/tmp/wp-hugo.zip</code> which I SCP&rsquo;d down to my laptop
and then unzipped into a directory called <code>hugo-export</code>.</p>
<h2 id="install-hugo-get-site-up-and-running">Install hugo get site up and running.</h2>
<p>The main goal here was to get Hugo running with the exported wordpress data.</p>
<p>After installing hugo with <code>brew install hugo</code>, I continued with Hugo&rsquo;s <a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/">quick
start instructions</a>.</p>
<p>Create the new Hugo site:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>hugo new site cpbotha.net
</code></pre><p>Copy the exported contents into the Hugo site:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>mv hugo-export/* cpbotha.net/content/
</code></pre><p>I chose <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-minos/">the minos theme</a> from the
great <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io">Hugo Themes repository</a> and installed it into
the new site like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>cd cpbotha.net/themes
git clone https://github.com/carsonip/hugo-theme-minos.git
</code></pre><p>Before starting up the new site for the first time, I edited the top-level

Components</a> mechanism.</p>
<h3 id="fire-up-hugo-in-development-mode">Fire up Hugo in development mode!</h3>
<p>To see your site in all of its new static glory, you can start Hugo in
development mode from the project&rsquo;s top-level directory:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>cd cpbotha.net/
hugo serve -D
</code></pre><p>By pointing your browser at <code>http://localhost:1313</code>, you&rsquo;ll be able to see a
dynamic version of your site that automatically refreshes whenever you make
changes to any of the underlying files.</p>
<h2 id="transfer-comments-to-disqus">Transfer comments to Disqus.</h2>
<p>This blog&rsquo;s small but amazing group of commenters, and the comments they have
written over the years, are super valuable to me. It was important to transfer
them and their work over to the new blog without a hitch.</p>
<h3 id="motivation">Motivation.</h3>
<p>I considered self-hosting comments using something like
<a href="https://github.com/adtac/commento">Commento</a>, but the fact that I was able to
get ad-free Disqus for free, as this site does not do advertising, and the
fact that the conversion from Wordpress to Disqus is well-documented, won me
over.</p>
<p>Furthermore, going from Wordpress to Commento often involves a quick stop at
Disqus in any case. In other words, the option of self-hosting remains.</p>
<h3 id="procedure">Procedure.</h3>
<p>The Disqus plugin for Wordpress has an automatic &ldquo;import comments&rdquo; mode which
promises to transfer all of your wordpress comments to Disqus.</p>
<p>In my case, this worked for most posts, except those with more than 60 or 70
comments, in thich no comments were transferred.</p>
<p>I ended up following the &ldquo;manual import&rdquo; procedure <a href="https://help.disqus.com/import-export-and-syncing/importing-comments-from-wordpress">documented in the Disqus
help</a>.</p>
<p>In short, you export your whole wordpress site as XML / WXR, download the
file, and then import that using the upload functionality of <a href="https://import.disqus.com/">the Disqus
import site</a>.</p>
<p>This seemed to have transferred all of my comments.</p>
<p>In spite of multiple attempts at automatic import, followed by the manual
import, Disqus was clever enough not to duplicate any comments.</p>
<h4 id="export-domain-name-should-be-same-as-display-domain-name">Export domain name should be same as display domain name.</h4>
<p>It is important when you export your Wordpress comments, that the domain-name
you export from is the same as the domain-name where you&rsquo;ll end up displaying
the Disqus comments.</p>
<p>If this is not the case, you will have to edit the exported XML files to
search and replaced all of the instances of export domain name to display
domain name.</p>
<h2 id="build-and-upload-the-new-static-hotness">Build and upload the new static hotness.</h2>
<p>My workflow now looks like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write new post in Emacs with <code>hugo serve -D</code> running. The browser window
adjacent to Emacs updates in real-time showing my changes. (I will eventually look into
<a href="https://ox-hugo.scripter.co">ox-hugo</a> so I can write posts in orgmode.)</li>
<li>When I&rsquo;m happy with the post, I build the site with <code>hugo -d ~/Downloads/cpbotha.net</code>
and sync it up to my web host using <code>rsync</code></li>
</ol>
<p>You can build the site by just invoking <code>hugo</code> in the top-level directory, in
which case the output of the build will end up in a sub-directory named
<code>public</code>.</p>
<p>However, I keep the source to this blog in a git repository in my Dropbox, and
I would prefer not syncing the expendable 600MB+ output directory, instead
building it and syncing it from <code>~/Downloads</code>.</p>
<p>The little bash script I used to perform step 2 in one go looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#586e75;background-color:#eee8d5;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span style="color:#93a1a1;font-style:italic">#!/bin/bash

</code></pre></div><h2 id="bonus-level-bundling-and-automatic-resizing-of-images">Bonus level: Bundling and automatic resizing of images.</h2>
<p>As each edition of <a href="categories/weekly-head-voices/">the WHV</a> usually contains
at least an image or two, an important piece of the puzzle was how to keep
images together with the markdown post source, instead of in a separate static
directory.</p>
<p>In addition, Wordpress has this great feature where it automatically resizes
images on upload, enabling posts to inline lower resolution versions that can
be clicked on to see the full resolution.</p>
<p>I had resigned myself to the reality that this would probably be a manual
process for Hugo.</p>
<p>Thanks to a <a href="https://laurakalbag.com/processing-responsive-images-with-hugo/">super useful and detailed post by Laura
Kalbag</a>, I
learned that the image-bundling problem had already been addressed by Hugo,
and that Laura Kalbag had developed a Hugo shortcode which solved the second
problem using Hugo&rsquo;s built-in image processing and a relatively new browser
feature called <a href="https://ericportis.com/posts/2014/srcset-sizes/">srcsets</a>.</p>
<p>With her <code>img</code> shortcode, high-resolution images are automatically resized
into multiple lower resolution versions at build time, all of which will be
offered to the client, which will then decide which to download based on the
client-side display parameters.</p>
<p>With regard to the image bundling, this is simply a matter of creating a
directory containing the relevant images and the post contents in a file
called <code>index.md</code>.</p>
<p>In my case, I would create a post by invoking the following command in the
top-level directory:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#586e75;background-color:#eee8d5;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">hugo new content/posts/2019/some-post-slug/index.md
</code></pre></div><p>Based on the <code>permalinks</code> setting in the <code>config.toml</code>, this post will be
available at <code>/year/month/day/slug-in-frontmatter/</code>. The <code>index.md</code> can refer
to images that are in the same directory using just their relative filenames.</p>
<h2 id="mailing-lists">Mailing lists.</h2>
<p>In addition to The Commenters mentioned above, I also treasure The Readers. :)</p>
<p>On the Wordpress blog, I had already started making use of
<a href="https://mailchimp.com/">Mailchimp</a> a while back for the daily and the weekly
post emails, in addition to Wordpress.com&rsquo;s own email subscription which
services the largest group of readers.</p>
<p>I briefly looked into <a href="https://tinyletter.com/">tinyletter</a>, but then decided
that it made the most sense to migrate the Wordpress.com email subscribers
over to the Mailchimp daily email list.</p>
<p>It was relatively straight-forward to export a CSV with subscriber address
from Wordpress.com and then to import that into the Mailchimp list.</p>
<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up.</h2>
<p>Converting this blog from Wordpress to Hugo went significantly more smoothly
than I expected. In fact, the first Hugo version was online after a single
evening of work.</p>
<p>Other than that, Hugo has already impressed me a number of times with its
speed, and features that have clearly been thought through. Besides the
built-in image processing and the theme composition, there are smaller but
still super useful features such as <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/archetypes/">the
archetypes</a> which I have
configured to help me start a blog post more easily.</p>
<p>Let me know in the comments if you have any other questions.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s to at least 18 more years of blog posts!</p>

<p>A Lie Can Travel Halfway Around the World While the Truth Is Putting On Its Shoes</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>(quote not by Mark Twain, <a href="http://quoteinvestigator.com/2014/07/13/truth/">origin quite interesting</a>)</em></p>
<p>Someone on facebook forwarded an article that was full of badly written and utterly unsubstantiated conspiracy theories about topic X. (topic X could be anything: politics, health, whatever)</p>
<p>To me, it was instantly clear that the article was 100%, undiluted, <strong>hogwash</strong>.</p>
<p>Now you probably think that I must have decades of experience separating the internet wheat from the chaff.</p>
<p>While that is true, you too can fortunately very quickly become a wheat-chaff-separation ninja by applying the following three super-easy steps.</p>
<h1 id="1-ensure-that-the-site-withthe-article-is-a-legitimate-source">1. Ensure that the site with the article is a legitimate source</h1>
<p>This is where most people get tripped up. Someone shares something on social media, you see it, and your blood boils, so you reshare without checking.</p>
<p>Next time, break the cycle by quickly checking the address of the news link. This is your first line of defense.</p>
<p>Here are some examples to get you started:</p>
<p><strong>Poppycock:</strong> naturalnews.com, worldunity.me, someconspiracy.wordpress.com, … (send me more)</p>
<p><strong>Legitimate:</strong> <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/">newscientist.com</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/">nytimes.com</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/">theguardian.com</a>, <a href="https://www.propublica.org/">propublica.org</a></p>
<p>It doesn’t take much practice to spot the pattern.</p>
<p>If the address looks like it could be a BS source, there’s a high probability it is. Remember, we live in the age of fake news, when any idiot can and will put up a website and fill it with misleading information.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Images with text on them shared on Facebook are instantly disqualified. Come on people, we can’t be that gullible!</p>
<p>If you’re still in doubt, continue on to the next step:</p>
<h1 id="2-search-for-the-site-andor-the-article-contents-onsnopes-and-on-google">2. Search for the site and/or the article contents on Snopes and on Google</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.snopes.com/">Snopes</a> is an absolute goldmine, and it’s free for you to use, so please do.</p>
<p>You can search for any topic or any story, and it will immediately give you a judgement of its veracity and a complete facts-based motivation for its decision.</p>
<p>If you can’t find anything on Snopes, googling the name of the site, or the contents of the story will often reward you with external sources to help you decide. Remember to apply rule 1 to the external sources you find.</p>
<h1 id="3-find-more-externallegitimate-sources-confirming-or-denying-the-contents-of-the-article">3. Find more external LEGITIMATE sources confirming or denying the contents of the article</h1>
<p>If after applying steps 1 and 2 you still have some doubt, try to find more <strong>external</strong> sources, applying rule 1 to each of these of course, that confirm or deny the contents of the article.</p>
<p>If you can’t find any legitimate external sources, that’s usually a sign that the article under study should be flatly ignored.</p>
<h1 id="profit">PROFIT!</h1>
<p>Only when you’ve applied all three steps, and they all have helped you to make the call that the link under study is not poppycock, only then consider sharing it with your internet friends.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you see a suspicious looking article shared by any of your friends, please do gently point them at this post!</p>

This is a really short note to help other people trying to get their broken Samsung Gear Fit 2 voice “guide at intervals” to work.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p><strong>Update 2017-05-02:</strong> <em>As reported by Kjetil in the comments, if you update the Health apps in the GEAR category of Galaxy Apps, this should fix the problem without having to change your phone’s language. I’m keeping the rest of the post here as a record of events.</em></p>
<p>This is a really short note to help other people trying to get their broken Samsung Gear Fit 2 voice “guide at intervals” to work.</p>
<p>In short, by activating the “guide at intervals” function on the Gear Fit 2, you can get a synthesised voice to give you all kinds of stats while you are running with bluetooth earphones. In my case, I set it up to give me distance, pacing and heart rate information every 0.5 km. This helps me to control my pace and extend my run.</p>
<p>After a recent phone swap, my Gear Fit 2 stopped giving me any kind of voice guidance. The music would continue playing, but at the first 0.5 km point when the voice guidance should have piped up, the watch would jump back to the watch face, instead of staying in the exercise app.</p>
<p>As seems to be par for the course with the Gear Fit 2, this was highly frustrating behaviour, with no help from the phone user interface or any of the Samsung documentation.</p>
<p>After some <a href="https://us.community.samsung.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/6831718">to-and-fro on the Samsung forums</a>, Dutch user BarryNL came up with the answer.</p>
<p>It turns out that if the phone language is set to anything other than “English (US)”, the voice guidance seems to crash the running app, dumping you at the watch face during your run.</p>
<p>I switched my phone from “English (South African)” to “English (US)”, rebooted the phone, then rebooted the Gear Fit 2, and finally went out for a quick test walk.</p>
<p>Samsung Gear Fit 2 voice guide at intervals was back!</p>
<p>I am really happy to have this core feature back, and to have the exercise app stay active until the end of my run. However, this undocumented behaviour, as well as the fact that the watch, which has more than enough processing power and a beautiful display, does not give any kind of feedback to help the user correct the issue, makes for an extremely frustrating experience.</p>

By “noticed”, I of course mean “got super frustrated with and considered briefly throwing the gadget onto the ground and arranging for its utter disintegration through repeated jumping on it”.</p>
<p>Besides losing the first 0.5 km of my run data, the pacing information, delivered via synthesised voice, would be wildly inaccurate for the rest of my run.</p>
<p>Judging by <a href="https://us.community.samsung.com/t5/forums/v3_1/forumtopicpage/board-id/wearabletech/thread-id/464/page/1">this 22 page thread on the Samsung community forums</a>, there are other users who were also less than happy that the Gear Fit 2 built-in GPS does not seem to work as advertised. Understandably, people bought the gadget in order to be able to go running without having to lug their smartphones along.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it turns out the explanation is quite logical, although Samsung really has to do better to communicate this to their users.</p>
<h1 id="why-does-mygear-fit-2-take-so-long-to-acquirea-gps-lock">Why does my Gear Fit 2 take so long to acquire a GPS lock?</h1>
<p>In short, at the start of my run, my smartphone was lying on my desk one floor up. At that point the Gear Fit 2 still had a bluetooth connection to the phone, and it was planning to use the phone GPS instead of its built-in unit. As far as I know, the gadget’s use of the phone’s GPS is not well known.</p>
<p>As the distance between me and the office building increased, the Gear Fit 2 obviously lost the bluetooth connection to the smartphone. With the current firmware (R360XXU1BPL1 at the time of writing), it takes the Gear Fit 2 about 0.5 km to realise that the connection is really lost, and that it should switch to its built-in GPS.</p>
<p>This as all pretty logical, but highly frustrating when you don’t know what’s going on. Samsung clearly has to do better.</p>
<h1 id="the-fix">The Fix</h1>
<p>Knowing what the issue is makes the fix pretty straight-forward.</p>
<p>Before starting your run, disable bluetooth on your smartphone, and wait for the Gear Fit 2 to register loss of the connection. It should vibrate on your wrist, and then show a little rectangle at the top right of the display, like this:<figure id="attachment_2749" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2749" style="width: 184px" class="wp-caption alignnone"></p>

<p>You can now start the exercise app and then start your run.</p>
<p>This morning, my Gear Fit 2 acquired a GPS lock almost instantly. You can see this by <strong>the location icon which briefly flashes and then stays on</strong> (it’s very important that you ensure that it stays on before running off), and by the fact that the on-screen distance gauge (you only see the distance gauge if you have set a distance target) starts climbing immediately.</p>
<p>(Update: I’ve had more runs since. Sometimes the GPS struggles for half a minute or more to get a lock, with the location icon remaining in the flashing state. In these cases, I sometimes stop the run, and start over, until that damned flashing location icon goes stable. Frustrating.)</p>
<h1 id="samsung-gear-fit-2-even-casual-runners-should-think-twice">Samsung Gear Fit 2: Even casual runners should think twice.</h1>
<p>For the price, the Samsung Gear Fit 2 packs a lot of features.</p>
<p>However, between this undocumented (as far as I can see) and sometimes plain frustrating GPS behaviour, the voice guidance which breaks easily and mysteriously (see <a href="/2017/01/21/samsung-gear-fit-2-voice-guide-at-intervals-not-working-at-all-the-fix/">another post of mine on that issue and how to fix it</a>), and the battery life (a 40 minute run with music and GPS can use up 30% to 40% of the battery), slightly more serious casual runners (strange category, I know) might want to consider carefully their alternatives.</p>

intensively, whereby the keyboard is in fact Dvorak, but all shortcut keys are
Qwerty, which is of course tremendously confusing. You can read more about the
issue in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/31119280/532513">this StackOverflow answer</a>.</p>
<p>I was postponing the upgrade to macOS Sierra, because Karabiner, fantastic
keyboard remapping tool, is unable to function on the new OS due to changed
APIs and whatnot.</p>
<p>Fortunately <a href="https://github.com/tekezo">Takayama Fumihiko</a>, awesome hacker behind Karabiner, has been
re-implementing his work in a new tool called <a href="https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements">Karabiner-Elements</a>. The GUI
is not up to pre-Sierra level yet, but the tool works perfectly to solve my
Dvorak-remapping (and other) issues!</p>
<p>After upgrading to Sierra, install from the dmg file, start Karabiner-Elements,
then copy <a href="https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements/blob/master/examples/qwerty_to_dvorak.json"><code>qwerty_to_dvorak.json</code> from the examples</a> into your
<code>~/.karabiner.d/configuration/</code> directory and name it <code>karabiner.json</code>. It will
be immediately picked up, so you&rsquo;re typing in Dvorak. <strong>NB: Since 2016, this
has changed. See new instructions in the update below!</strong></p>
<p>Personally I have also added the relevant lines from the
<code>change_caps_lock_to_left_control.json</code> and
<code>change_section_key_to_accent_key.json</code> examples to the <code>simple_modifications</code>
clause of my <code>karabiner.json</code> file. Using caps-lock as control is essential for
efficient Emacs use, and that section key at the top-left of the MBP 2015
keyboards should have been backtick / tilde to start with.</p>
<h2 id="update-on-2021-01-06-qwerty_to_dvorakjson-missing-">Update on 2021-01-06: <code>qwerty_to_dvorak.json</code> missing :(</h2>
<p>Andrei in the comments has let me know that <code>qwerty_to_dvorak.json</code> is not
available on the karabiner elements github anymore.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve searched in the <a href="https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/docs/">karabiner
docs</a>, but could find no mention of
Dvorak.</p>
<p>So, in case it helps anyone, my old <code>karabiner.json</code> is shown below. Yours
should be at <code>~/.config/karabiner/karabiner.json</code>. You should be able to copy
over the <code>simple_modifications</code> clause from the example below.</p>
