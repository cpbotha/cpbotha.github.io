In it, the author explains how they did an “experiment” demonstrating that topics they discussed verbally were later reflected in Facebook ads.</p>
<p>Whilst it’s prudent to be careful with modern technology around one’s privacy, Vice is being a tad sensationalist. This blog post, which will optimistically be read by three to four people, tries to fill some of the holes they left.</p>
<p>We already know that we can’t trust Facebook in any way, so we are dependent on the telephone’s operating system to take our privacy seriously: That’s usually Android or iOS.</p>
<p>Android does in theory <em>enable</em> background recording up to and including Android O, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2018/3/7/17091104/android-p-prevents-apps-using-mic-camera-idle-background">starting from Android P</a> it will disable this. Unfortunately, it shouldn’t be more than about 10 years before all phones are on Android P or later.</p>
<p>(<a href="/2016/11/27/android-security-in-2016-is-a-mess/">I have previously indicated that I’m not the biggest fan of Android’s security story</a>. I am happy to see that they are making such progress, but the tardiness or even worse refusal of OEMs in upgrading their devices diminishes most of that.)</p>
<p>In iOS on the other hand, there are at least three mechanisms that protect users against this background recording abuse:</p>
<ol>
<li>The app has to ask the user explicitly for microphone permission, which the user can easily revoke at any time (Settings | App’s name | Microphone; see screenshot below for an example).</li>
<li>The developer has to indicate explicitly and statically in their app that they intend to use background audio. Apple’s review process is quite strict and will reject outright an app that does not have a legitimate reason to make use of this function.</li>
<li>Even when an app has been able to convince Apple’s review process that it should be allowed to record audio in the background, there are two more privacy mechanisms in place:
<ol>
<li>An app can only record in the background, if it started to record audio whilst on the foreground. When the recording stops, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/iPhone/Conceptual/iPhoneOSProgrammingGuide/BackgroundExecution/BackgroundExecution.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007072-CH4-SW26">the app will be suspended</a>.</li>
<li>When any app is recording, the system will display a big red bar at the top of the iOS display, much like the blue bar which displays when a location-based app such as Google Maps or Waze is active in the background. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/39963079/532513">This red bar can’t be hidden</a>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To see this in action (another “experiment” !!), download an app like <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/awesome-voice-recorder/id892208399?mt=8">Awesome Voice Recorder</a> which advertises background recording, start a recording, and then switch anywhere else. The red bar looks like this (I’ve switched the app permissions screen in iOS settings, so you can also see where to disable the microphone permissions):

            alt="AVR is recording in the background, so iOS shows this red bar at the top. If you tap on the red bar, it will switch to the app which is recording. This is related to the blue bar for location, and the green bar for ongoing phone calls."/> </a><figcaption>

</p>
<p>With the above measures in place, it would be fairly tricky for an iOS app to perform background recording without your knowledge.</p>
<p>For some extra peace of mind, you can disable the app’s (a totally random example being Facebook) microphone permissions. If the app ever really needs to record, iOS will have to ask your permission again.</p>
<p>P.S. In iOS, under Settings | Privacy | Microphone you can find a handy list of all apps that have successfully requested microphone permissions. From here, you can also easily remove any of these permissions.</p>

The short story Story of your life, on which the movie is based, has a fascinating premise. However, I do hear that the film does not spend that much time on her discovery of and assimilation by the alien writing system “Heptapod B”, which to me was one of the more interesting threads.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <div class="jetpack-video-wrapper">

<p>Intrigued by the trailers of the movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrival_(film)">The Arrival</a>, which I have not seen yet, I read the short story compilation <em>Stories of your life and others</em> by Ted Chiang.</p>
<p>The short story <em>Story of your life</em>, on which the movie is based, has a fascinating premise. However, I do hear that the film does not spend that much time on her discovery of and assimilation by the alien writing system “Heptapod B”, which to me was one of the more interesting threads.</p>
<p>Anyways, this post is not about that story.</p>
<p>It’s about another story in the collection called <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31682236-liking-what-you-see">Liking What You See: A Documentary</a>, written way back in 2002.</p>
<p>Close to the end, an initially strong campaign for <em>calliagnosia</em> (a non-invasive and highly selective procedure to remove humans’ innate appreciation of attractiveness in others, already a great science-fiction philosophy prop) at the fictitious but influential unversity Pembleton is lost at the last minute due to a highly persuasive televised speech by the leader of the opposition.</p>
<p>Read the following extract for how exactly this was done:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the latest on the Pembleton calliagnosia initiative, EduNews has learned that a new form of digital manipulation was used on the broadcast  of PEN spokesperson Rebbecca Boyer’s speech. EduNews has received files from the SemioTech Warriors that contain what appear to be two recorded versions of the speech: an original — acquired from the Wyatt/Hayes (ed: PR firm) computers — and the broadcast version. The files also include the SemioTech Warriors’ analysis of the difference between the two versions.</p>
<p>The discrepancies are primarily enhancements to Ms. Boyer’s voice intonation, facial expressions and body language. Viewers who watch the original version rate Ms. Boyer’s performance as good, while those who watch the edited version rate her performance as excellent, describing her as extraordinarily dynamic and persuasive. The SemioTech Warriors conclude that Wyatt/Hayes has developed new software capabable of fine-tuning paralinguistic cues in order to maximize the emotional response evoked in viewers. This dramatically increases the effectiveness of recorded presentations … and its use in the PEN broadcast is likely what caused many supporters of the calliagnosia initiative to change their votes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would like to remind you that Ted Chiang wrote that story in 2002.</p>
<p>When I read this, I had to sit still for a moment, thinking about all of the advanced techniques that are currently being used to analyse us all, and then to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/26/robert-mercer-breitbart-war-on-media-steve-bannon-donald-trump-nigel-farage">manipulate or even manufacture news with the explicit purpose of swaying public opinion in a specific direction</a>.</p>
<p>My thoughts moved on to the great advances being made with deep learning based human speech synthesis, <a href="http://www.graphics.stanford.edu/~niessner/thies2016face.html">facial re-enactment</a> (see youtube at the top of this post), <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/11/adobe-voco-photoshop-for-audio-speech-editing/">cut-and-paste voice editing</a> (Adobe’s VoCo) and much much more.</p>
<p>Up to now, the major mechanisms of influence have been curating <em>which</em> packets of information people consume. However, the tools for also modifying the <em>contents</em> of these packets of information seem to be ready.</p>
<p>We’ve been photoshopping photos of people to make those people appear more attractive since forever.</p>
<p>How long before we start seriously “videoshopping” televised speeches to make them more persuasive? With people consuming ever-increasing amounts of potentially personalised video, there’s an even bigger opportunity for those who desire to influence us for reasons less pure than just edification.</p>
