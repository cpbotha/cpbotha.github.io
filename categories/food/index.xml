Amongst a number of impressive-sounding statements, the back of the bottle concludes with:
Lumberjack has a sturdy malt driven backbone packed with loads of roasted malt. Huge hop additions intensify the piney-citrus aromas of this full flavoured ale. A beer for the brave.
After reading that, who does not want to drink this beer for the brave?</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>Jack Black brewery’s Lumberjack is an amber ale craft brewed in Cape Town. As bottle designs go, this one is pretty <em>metal</em>:</p>

<p>Amongst a number of impressive-sounding statements, the back of  the bottle concludes with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lumberjack has a sturdy malt driven backbone packed with loads of roasted malt. Huge hop additions intensify the piney-citrus aromas of this full flavoured ale. A beer for the brave.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After reading that, who does <em>not</em> want to drink this <strong>beer for the brave</strong>?! Based on extensive testing, I can report that this is indeed a full-bodied beer that deserves and rewards your full attention.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://blacksmithskitchen.co.za/">Blacksmith’s Kitchen</a> is a vineyard restaurant in Paarl. It looks like this:</p>

        /> </a>
</figure>

<p>The views from the outside tables are quite beautiful:</p>

<p>Weather permitting (which is very often in Paarl), this kitchen is absolutely worth a visit.</p>

As hinted to in a previous post, I was on my way to Brazil.
The hint took more concrete shape with me visiting Dr. Rosane Minghim and colleagues at the Instituto de Ciências Matemáticas e de Computação (ICMC) of the Universidade de São Paulo. One of the many perks of my job is that I get to travel (nice) and meet many exceptionally cool people (great): The week in Brazil was an extreme example of that.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>Wow, wow, wow.</p>
<p>As hinted to in a <a href="http://cpbotha.net/2008/08/23/life-update/" title="previous blog post with hint">previous post</a>, I was on my way to Brazil.</p>
<p>The hint took more concrete shape with me visiting Dr. Rosane Minghim and colleagues at the <a href="http://www.icmc.usp.br/" title="ICMC website">Instituto de Ciências Matemáticas e de Computação (ICMC)</a> of the Universidade de São Paulo.  One of the many perks of my job is that I get to travel (nice) and meet many exceptionally cool people (great):  The week in Brazil was an extreme example of that.  Shortly after setting foot on the South American continent for the first time, I started running into them.  A whole series of amazingly warm and engaging contacts with people that I had mostly never seen before.  Every lunch and every dinner from day one was either at someone’s house, with their family, or somewhere in the city, at a restaurant (I’ll get back to the foody bits later…), in the company of interesting and very social people.  I had many profound conversations, a healthy percentage being entirely unrelated to work.  All of this meaningful activity had a definite effect on my perception of time: By the end of the week, it felt like I had been there and known the people for much longer than possible in 7 days.  You would be correct in guessing that I’m still slightly stunned. :)</p>
<p>Oh yes, before I touch on the foody goodness that is Brazilian cuisine, I would like to point out that I’ve now too discovered the centre of the world.  It’s in São Carlos, and it looks almost exactly like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/bdgOy_fmUgpThcE0wm9dhQ"><img alt="" class="alignnone" height="300" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/cpbotha/SML7xUgElgI/AAAAAAAADNc/Z2oKDrPnTkE/s400/IMG_3916.JPG" width="400"/></a></p>
<p>Brazil counts around 190 million inhabitants.  I’ve only seen a miniscule part of that, but what I’ve seen concerning the relationship Brazilians have with eating and drinking is simply inspiring.  In my few days there, my mouth had the pleasure of meeting with the exquisite Ms. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caipirinha" title="Wikipedia article on Caipirinha">Caipirinha</a> (home-made ones, bar-made ones, frozen ones; I will HAVE to get more of those), numerous shots of <a href="http://www.maria-brazil.org/brazilian_cafezinho.htm" title="cafezinho, i want one now!">cafezinho</a> and other Brazilian coffee in its various delectable forms, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moqueca" title="Wikipedia article on Moqueca">Moqueca</a> (twice home-made, and once on the plane!), lots of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guarana" title="Wikipedia on guaraná">Guaraná</a> (the kids drink it like cooldrink!), some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%C3%A7a%C3%AD_na_tigela" title="wikipedia on acai">açaí na tigela</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farofa" title="wikipedia has an article on farofa?!">farofa</a>, several instances of the typical Brazilian mix of rice, beans and somehow integrated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassava" title="manioc at wikipedia">manioc</a>, fried banana, a <a href="http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churrasco" title="wikipedia on churrasco">churrasco</a> that brought tears of joy to my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braai" title="so, what's a braai?">braai</a>-attuned South African eyes and finally, the cake of all cakes, the sweetness that can make a grown man whimper: The Torta Paulista.  See it below in all its glory:</p>
<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/OK6qEx2KkAdmyr1E3NBVhA"><img alt="Torta Paulista" class="alignnone" height="300" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/cpbotha/SML7v_vNHLI/AAAAAAAADNU/A1Aijbu_zi0/s400/IMG_3993.JPG" width="400"/></a></p>
<p>I’ll remember this week as <strong>the month</strong> I spent in Brazil making new friends and keeping my brain happily submerged in dopamine.  Via this blog post I’d also like to thank everyone that I had the singular pleasure of having contact with.  I am now officially a fan of ICMC, the USP, São Carlos and the whole of Brazil.  Sometimes generalising can be good.</p>
<p>In case anybody thinks that it was all work and no play, I’d like to submit the photo below as evidence to the contrary.  In it you can see my notebook on a table in the centre of the world shortly after I’d spilled coffee all over it.  It’s the perfect summary of my visit to Brazil.</p>

Ontbijtkoek is a very typically Dutch spiced cake that is often eaten in the morning, whilst Hagelslag is the Dutch word for chocolate sprinkles, which people from around these parts like to use as a bread topping, also mostly in the mornings.

<p>However, when you combine them, it’s a completely different story. The spongy texture and spicy demeanour of the ontbijtkoek mingle sensually with the smooth brittleness of the hagelslag to result in nothing less than a taste and texture explosion!</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, it was an exceptionally difficult judging process, but it pleases me greatly to present to you The Ultimate Dutch Snack! (*)</p>

<p>It’s a so-called <em>family pack</em>, I prefer to call it The Addict’s Friend. There are eight (8) servings in there, man! Notice the big ‘8’ on the package promoting this fact. There is also 30% more or less of something else in there, but I’ll probably never know exactly what.</p>
<p>In any case, this miso is nice, and has more floating thingies in there, but somehow not as nice as <a href="http://cpbotha.net/2007/04/04/lovely-miso-soup/" title="First instant miso posting on cpbotha.net.">the other stuff</a>. (Yes, I know, I should work on my miso terminology.)</p>
