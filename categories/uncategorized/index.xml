A crazy number of hours of studying scientific literature (a quick count in the bbl file yields 1880 cited references!!), trying to fit everything into a coherent conceptual framework and then trying to write all of it down as a more or less readable story has finally led to more than 1000 pages of Medical Visualization reading pleasure.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>For the past 2.5 years, I have been helping my friend <a href="http://isgwww.cs.uni-magdeburg.de/~bernhard/" title="bernhard's website">Prof. Bernhard Preim</a> to write the new Medical Visualization textbook. A crazy number of hours of studying scientific literature (a quick count in the bbl file yields 1880 cited references!!), trying to fit everything into a coherent conceptual framework and then trying to write all of it down as a more or less readable story has finally led to more than 1000 pages of Medical Visualization reading pleasure.</p>
<p>It looks like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://medvisbook.com/"><img alt="" class="alignnone" height="922" src="http://medvisbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/cover_full_20130729.jpg" width="1650"/></a></p>
<p>The title has been changed to <em>Visual Computing for Medicine</em> to reflect the significant rework, and also the broader treatment of the field. The book itself is 836 pages with hundreds of colour figures. Five chapters (190+ pages) are <a href="http://medvisbook.com/online-chapters/" title="medvisbook online chapters">available exclusively online</a>, free to download.</p>
<p>Go to <a href="http://medvisbook.com/" title="medvisbook website">the book website</a> (run by us) to read more <a href="http://medvisbook.com/about/" title="about the book">about the contents</a> of the book, and to find out <a href="http://medvisbook.com/where-to-buy/" title="where to buy">where you can get your very own copy</a>!</p>
<p>P.S. It was a huge pleasure working on the book together with Bernhard. (We’ve been collaborating quite intensively since the end of 2007 somewhere, when we started setting up the <a href="http://www.vcbm.org/" title="VCBM website">Eurographics Workshops on Visual Computing for Biology and Medicine</a>, which have since then been held in 2008, 2010, 2012 and will be held again in 2014 in Vienna.) Just for the record, he definitely put a great deal more work into the book than I did. The exact ratio will remain our secret.</p>

<p>To use this from Python, you need to add the following to your PATH:</p>
<ul>
<li>d:\opt\VTK\bin</li>
</ul>
<p>You also need to add <strong>all of the above</strong> to PYTHONPATH, as well as the following:</p>

<p>Once you’ve done this and logged out and in again, “import vtk” should work at the Python prompt. Shameless plug: you can use my free <a href="../software/envedit" title="envedit homepage">envedit</a> software to do the environment editing. It beats the default XP editing thingy.</p>

<p>Remember, all operating systems suck completely, even Loonix, the shareware system written by Luunis Torvaldez, the Mexican hacker responsible for other shareware greats, such as the desktop environment Gloom.</p>
<p>Because this is a long(ish) text, I’ll subtly hint at the conclusion: print support in Ubuntu sucks really badly, which is all the more crappy because Ubuntu is otherwise a fine distribution. Now back to my story…</p>
<p>In any case, today I lost a few precious hours of my life (I really had more important things to do) trying to configure the printer on my Ubuntu 6.06 server as a public / guest access printer. In other words, <strong>anyone</strong> attached to my network should be able to print to this printer.</p>
<p>First attempt: get the Ubuntu CUPS installation to accept print requests from remote clients via IPP. This was working just fine under CentOS 4.x, thank you. After much gnashing of teeth and editing of config files (necessary “allow” clauses and what not), clients could get printer status and could even access the admin pages on :631, but could not print. Nothing helpful in the log files, even with higher log levels. It turns out that Ubuntu doesn’t really support this setup: they prefer that one comes in through Samba.</p>
<p>Second attempt: configure the samba printer for public access. This FINALLY worked when I set “security = share”, but the samba manuals warn against this and strongly discourage its use. ARGH. Can you configure a public printer with security = user? It seems not.</p>
<p>So, Linux has been around in some form or another for 15 years… every year we are promised that “This year will be the year of Linux! Ready for the desktop I say!” and every year it still sucks in new and original ways. Yes, nerdy administrators itching to leave a comment, Linux works well if you’re an *nally retentive git with nothing else to do but read manuals and browse source code (or just an otherwise well-adjusted student with too much time), but for the rest of us with Real Work and Other Things To Do, <strong>this just doesn’t cut it</strong>.</p>
