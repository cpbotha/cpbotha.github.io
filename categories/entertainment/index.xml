As bottle designs go, this one is pretty metal:
Amongst a number of impressive-sounding statements, the back of the bottle concludes with:
Lumberjack has a sturdy malt driven backbone packed with loads of roasted malt. Huge hop additions intensify the piney-citrus aromas of this full flavoured ale. A beer for the brave.
After reading that, who does not want to drink this beer for the brave?</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>Jack Black brewery’s Lumberjack is an amber ale craft brewed in Cape Town. As bottle designs go, this one is pretty <em>metal</em>:</p>

<p>Amongst a number of impressive-sounding statements, the back of  the bottle concludes with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lumberjack has a sturdy malt driven backbone packed with loads of roasted malt. Huge hop additions intensify the piney-citrus aromas of this full flavoured ale. A beer for the brave.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After reading that, who does <em>not</em> want to drink this <strong>beer for the brave</strong>?! Based on extensive testing, I can report that this is indeed a full-bodied beer that deserves and rewards your full attention.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://blacksmithskitchen.co.za/">Blacksmith’s Kitchen</a> is a vineyard restaurant in Paarl. It looks like this:</p>

        /> </a>

<p>The views from the outside tables are quite beautiful:</p>

<p>Weather permitting (which is very often in Paarl), this kitchen is absolutely worth a visit.</p>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://vcbm.org/2008" title="Link to VCBM 2008 website">VCBM 2008 workshop</a>, my first attempt at playing the organising conference chair, went swimmingly.  Two days of solid presentations, a lovely dinner at Van der Dussen (no Ronald McDonald in sight!) and meeting up with many old friends.  I stopped stressing during the conference dinner.</li>
<li>I joined the ranks of the intelligentsia (As opposed to the millions of plebs with iPhones – oh stop whining and look at the stats.  Can’t find the stats?  Go figure out how to copy and paste, then get back to me. :) ) and acquired a Nokia E71.  <em>Best. Gadget. EVAR.</em></li>
<li>Had a fan-tas-tic holiday in South Africa.  Had profound conversations and the most raucous get-togethers with best friends and family.  Realised again how extremely lucky I am with people I’m this close with, on two different continents.  Linked up with my dad for the first time in too many years, which was cool.</li>
<li>Migrated my extremely complex todo system (I’m a foaming-at-the-mouth <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done" title="Link to Wikipedia article on GTD">GTD</a> follower) from <a href="http://todoist.com/" title="Link to Todoist">todoist</a> to a local installation of the open-source RoR-based <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/projects/" title="Link to Tracks website.">Tracks</a> software.  Todoist is really cool, but it’s very much deadline-oriented, whilst in the GTD world deadlines are just so passé.  DAMN I’m with it.</li>
<li>My laptop was sort of stolen and then returned 5 minutes later.  Besides the acute trauma that this caused, it got me wondering about the security of the Windows XP Encrypted File System thingy that I use to encrypt some of the more sensitive, err, documents on my laptop.  On Windows 2000, the fact that on a local install the administrator was the default data recovery agent (DRA), made it possible to decrypt a user’s files without having to crack that user’s password.  On a local install of XP, this is fortunately NOT the case.  I repeat, <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/887414" title="Link to MS KB article concerning DRA on XP."><strong>on a local install of XP there is no default recovery policy</strong></a>.  In other words, a laptop thief needs to <strong>crack your password to decrypt your EFS encryption</strong>.  You can double check this by <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=9c70306d-0ef3-4b0c-ab61-81da208f5c47&amp;displaylang=en" title="Link to efsinfo">downloading efsinfo</a> and running it on your files with “efsinfo /u /r your_files”.  It should confirm that there’s no recovery agent.  You should also check the strength of your Windows passwords with <a href="http://ophcrack.sourceforge.net/" title="Link to ophcrack.">ophcrack</a>.  Your EFS is only as strong as the user password protecting it.  After my little episode, I’ve deleted most of those sensitive, err, documents from my laptop (they’re duplicated on a server at home) and encrypted even larger parts of my laptop hard drive, just in case.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now I’m supposed to conclude this blow-by-blow with something profound.  I know, I’ll end with a quote attributed to Plato that I first saw in the PhD thesis of a friendly colleague.  At the time it made quite an impression on me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="huge">Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Heck, it still does.</p>

<p>If <a href="http://www.imdb.com/video/editorial/me60339838/" title="Iron Man trailer on IMDB">the trailer</a> is anything to go by, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371746/" title="Iron Man page on IMDB">the 2008 movie</a> is going to rock so incredibly hard.  Robert Downey Junior is the male lead, which is already a good indication, but the fact that they’ve actually went and used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sabbath" title="Black Sabbath page on Wikipedia">Black Sabbath</a>‘s <a data-rel="lightbox-video-0" href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=udEDlOZJmCc" title="Youtube video of Black Sabbath doing Iron Man at Ozzfest">Iron Man</a> in the sound track is a sure sign that <em>someone</em> knows <em>exactly</em> what they’re doing.</p>
