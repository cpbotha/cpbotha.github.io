Dear friends,
I looked through my notes of the two weeks from Monday June 15 to Sunday June 28, 2020, and found almost nothing but work, work, and then, in a dusty, dark corner right at the bottom of my Emacs&amp;hellip; more work.

<p>Dear friends,</p>
<p>I looked through my notes of the two weeks from Monday June 15 to Sunday June
28, 2020, and found almost nothing but work, work, and then, in a dusty, dark
corner right at the bottom of my Emacs&hellip; more work.</p>
<h2 id="a-totally-unexpected-ramble-on-cycles-patterns-and-teleportation">A totally unexpected ramble on cycles, patterns and teleportation</h2>
<p>Life seems to consist of the superposition of so many cycles over so many
domains, each at a different frequency and phase.</p>
<p>At this moment, my backyard philosophy cycle seems to have taken a backseat,
whilst my over-use of vehicle metaphors cycle can&rsquo;t believe its luck.</p>
<p>On the topic of cycles, and of not doing backyard philosophy, do you remember
my old <a href="/2014/05/07/weekly-head-voices-70-patterns-in-the-sand/">patterns in the sand post</a>, which I recently also mentioned in <a href="/2020/04/13/weekly-head-voices-191-covid-19-part-2/">WHV #191</a>?</p>
<p>That was the one where I talked about 98% of your atoms being recycled every
year, which helps to understand why the concept of a single consistent &ldquo;I&rdquo;
going through life is mostly an illusion.</p>
<p>Well, I mention this again right now, because these cycles do seem to be
related, or maybe they are a contrasting idea.</p>
<p>On the one hand, maybe the I sitting here typing this has only 75% overlap with
the I of 6 months ago.</p>
<p>Maybe the 25% that has now been &ldquo;cycled&rdquo; in (haha) has different priorities,
and maybe over the coming months those priorities will shift the whole even
more in a different direction.</p>
<p>In my ever-changing mind, all of this also casts interesting light on one of
the favourite philosophical paradoxes of Star Trek nerds the world over: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletransportation%5Fparadox">The
Teletransportation paradox</a>.</p>
<p>You might be surprised to know that Trekkies have bee wondering about this as
far back as 1775! (see the linked Wikipedia article above)</p>
<p>In short (oh who am I kidding), this asks the question:</p>
<p>If it were possible to reconstruct you, atom-by-atom, in a different place
(this is essentially what the Star Trek transporters do, with the one
qualification that they mostly disassemble the departing you before assembling
the arriving you), the you on the other side would have your thoughts and your
feelings, but would it really be you?</p>
<p>If one were not inclined to thinking about matters such as these for
entertainment, one might easily write it off as far too abstract.</p>
<p>However, how long do you think before we are able to copy (parts of) a human
neural network to a different substrate that is able to run it?</p>
<p>In other words, how long do you think before we are able to upload a copy of a
human brain to a sufficiently powerful computer?</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial%5Fgeneral%5Fintelligence">AGI</a> (Artificial General Intelligence) is certainly quite far off, but the
discussions about it are quite serious already.</p>
<p>Parts of the technology required for AGI are at least in the same ballpark as
some of the parts that are required for uploading.</p>
<p>(I&rsquo;m reading another one of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal%5FAsher">Neal Asher&rsquo;s</a> books at the moment. You couldn&rsquo;t
tell, could you?)</p>
<p>On the other hand (you&rsquo;re going to have to scroll back to find the first
hand. sorry), it could just be 100% boring human rhythm.</p>
<p>Just the other day, I got to bed far too late thanks to a coding session
getting out of hand, followed by the above-mentioned book pulling me in
again. Matthew Walker, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>The next day was hugely productive, with will-power to spare and my brain
running on turbo mode until late in the afternoon.</p>
<p>On other occasions I pay close attention to sleep, diet, exercise, prayer
beads, crystals, pyramids and aliens, and then the next day is a total wash:
Brain checking out middle morning, and will-power calling in early to take the
day off to play old Flash games online.</p>
<p>I called it human rhythm above, but I suspect an extremely influential part of
that is <em>mood</em>.</p>
<p>Looking after the physical components (sleep, exercise, diet, pyramids) remains
crucial, and does form the basis of one&rsquo;s performance, but one&rsquo;s mood can cause
massive course changes regardless.</p>
<p>Trying to be a good human can be tough.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-was-actually-planning-to-write">What I was actually planning to write</h2>
<p>With the being &ldquo;a bit stubborn&rdquo; mentioned in the title, I meant that I was
<em>planning</em> a perfunctory blog check-in <em>despite</em> not finding anything in my
notes to write about.</p>
<p>(I consoled myself with the fact that at least I had the great photo above,
contributed by occasional readers from right within my inner circle.)</p>
<p>As has happened a few times before, the ritual of sitting down (well lying in
bed with laptop, sorry again Matthew Walker) to write a few sentences drew out
the ramble above from the thoughts that just five minutes prior had indicated
quite sternly that they had absolutely nothing to say.</p>
<p>Besides the photo above, I did want to mention the following two gems I ran
into during the previous weeks:</p>
<h3 id="siren">SIREN</h3>
<p><a href="https://vsitzmann.github.io/siren/"><em>Implicit Neural Representations with Periodic Activation Functions</em></a>, a
technique also known as SIREN for &ldquo;sinusoidal representation networks&rdquo;, uses
sinusoidal activation functions instead of the ubiquitous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier%5F(neural%5Fnetworks)">ReLU</a> to model images,
sound, video and even signed distance fields.</p>
<p>This is a great example of implicit representation learning with neural
networks, something that has been fascinating me for a while now.</p>
<p>In this case, they even demonstrate the neural network learning to predict a
signed distance field (SDF) based on a point cloud with normals.</p>
<p>(At some point in the past, it looked like my new middle name was going to be
&ldquo;distance field&rdquo;, based on the sheer number of times that it came up as the
answer to any problem that we were trying to solve.)</p>
<p>The video by the authors is a great 10 minute summary of what you could do with
SIREN:</p>

<h3 id="more-about-john-carmack-programming-god">More about John Carmack, programming god</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve <a href="/2018/03/11/weekly-head-voices-135-its-all-rainbows-and-unicorns-no-really/#the-carmack-productivity-method-cpm">written previously about the Carmack Productivity Method</a>, named after a
story about John Carmack using a CD Player as a tool to boost his already
prodigious productivity and focus.</p>
<p>More recently, I really enjoyed reading the following write-up of the history
of <em>id software</em>, including much more about John Carmack:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.filfre.net/2020/05/the-shareware-scene-part-3-the-id-boys/">The Shareware Scene, Part 3: The id Boys</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.filfre.net/2020/06/the-shareware-scene-part-4-doom/">The Shareware Scene, Part 4: DOOM</a></li>
</ul>
<p>When he joined the group of young people who would later come to be known as
<em>id software</em>, he was just 19 years old, but the programming genius within was
already strong.</p>
<p>With Carmack at the core, <em>id software</em> would go on to write game programming
history.</p>
<h2 id="the-end">The end</h2>
<p>Thank you for reading any of this my peeps, I am truly grateful for the
connection.</p>

<h2 id="on-attempting-to-publish-the-whv-on-a-weekly-basis">On attempting to publish the WHV on a weekly basis.</h2>
<p>Somewhere at the end of the first week, I sat down to write, but I soon
realised that I didn&rsquo;t have all that much to say.</p>
<p>Ironically, earlier that day I had had an online discussion where I made the
statement that I preferred putting out posts regularly, rather than waiting
until until I had something &ldquo;really good&rdquo; to publish.</p>
<p>In the latter case, one tends to let things slip further and further, with that
great internal excuse that one&rsquo;s ideas and writing do not yet satisfy one&rsquo;s
otherwise unspecified but high standards.</p>
<p>In addition, one&rsquo;s performance anxiety is now fueled into a frenzy by the
illusion that surely the expectations of one&rsquo;s audience are growing greater by
the minute, and hence the next post will be measured even more strictly against
the mythical yard stick of blog posts that in reality very few people, mostly
friends, actually take the time to read.</p>
<p>So that happened.</p>
<p>As is the case with many other things in life that seem to follow the Sisyphean
ideal, I have made peace with the fact that I will just continue working at
this, until the end.</p>
<h2 id="a-call-from-the-future">A call from the future.</h2>
<p>I made three longer term technology-themed bets with friends and colleagues at
the IEEE VisWeek conference in 2009.</p>
<p>The idea was that the first of the three would play out and finally be
evaluated at VisWeek 2019 (10 years later), and the other two more or less 20
years later, to be decided at Visweek 2029.</p>
<p>Fortunately I wrote the bets up in a blog post, all the way back in 2009,
titled <a href="/2009/10/18/futuristic-betting-at-visweek-2009/">Futuristic Betting at VisWeek
2009</a>.</p>
<p>To my surprise, but far more to my delight, an overlapping subset of the
involved friends and colleagues recorded an hour-long video message at <a href="http://ieeevis.org/year/2019/welcome">VisWeek
2019 in Vancouver</a> and sent it to me via
the YouTubes.</p>
<p>The main message of their video was that I had lost bet #1, with which I could
agree, and that they had their doubts about my chances in bets #2 and #3, with
which I can not yet agree.</p>
<p>You can read <a href="/2009/10/18/futuristic-betting-at-visweek-2009/#update-on-2019-10-27">the addendum I made to the original blog
post</a> for
all of the details.</p>
<p>When I made those predictions, confident that we would be able to debate and
laugh about them at those future conferences, I ironically had no idea that my
life was going to take the turns that it did, <a href="/2013/03/09/dear-academia-i-hope-we-can-still-be-friends/">out of
academia</a> and
shortly thereafter <a href="/2013/12/14/on-leaving-the-netherlands/">out of Europe</a>.</p>
<p>Fortunately, that futuristic betting blog post seems to have functioned as a
sort of anchor in the sands of time, playing its small part in making the
connection from 2009 to 2019, from Atlantic City to Vancouver and even to
Somerset West.</p>
<p>What will happen in 2029?</p>
<h2 id="humans-predicting-the-world-in-real-time">Humans predicting the world in real-time.</h2>
<p>Based on <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-10/sisd-py101419.php">this recent EEG-based experimental
study</a>, it
sounds like our brains are continuously predicting the next word that someone
we&rsquo;re in conversation with is going to say.</p>
<p>Especially in noisy environments, such as IN DA CLUB, this helps us to
understand what our conversation partners are saying.</p>
<p>What struck me when I read the linked press release, and shortly thereafter
tried to assimilate <a href="https://www.eneuro.org/content/6/5/ENEURO.0128-19.2019">the full
article</a>, quite
attractively titled <em>Neural Signal to Violations of Abstract Rules Using
Speech-Like Stimuli</em>, was that is exactly what computer-based language models
do.</p>
<p><em>Language models</em> are mathematical constructs, which mostly live in software,
that attempt to predict the next word in a sentence, based on the previous
words in a sequence.</p>
<p>Recently, <a href="http://www.fit.vutbr.cz/research/groups/speech/publi/2010/mikolov_interspeech2010_IS100722.pdf">deep learning approaches overtook the more classical statistical
approaches for building such language
models</a>.</p>
<p>Given a few thousand articles in French for example, a neural network can learn
how to predict the next word in any given French sentence with high accuracy.</p>
<p>Together with the fact that the internet is now overflowing with examples of
many human languages, anyone with some spare time and GPU cycles to burn can
train up a language model, or even download a pre-trained example.</p>
<p>Such a language model can then be
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146">fine-tuned</a> for other language tasks such as
sentiment analysis and topic classification.</p>
<p>I enjoyed seeing this (growing) similarity between our built-in language
processing wetware and the rapidly developing world of deep learning.</p>
<p>Maybe you did too.</p>
<p>Just a little bit.</p>
