Went to the beach at just after 11:00. Brilliant weather which for Betty&amp;rsquo;s is quite special, so the place was absolutely packed. Finally created org-capture-template to do the Daily Head Voices post setup more easily and more consistently, see below for the relevant element. Thought a bit about writing and then self-hosting the tool that scans the cpbotha.net RSS feed and then performs actions, e.g. sending to Telegram, when new posts appear Initial thought was Go, because small and self-contained (like my discord scihub bot and my eureka-alert RSS feed generator), but Python means much higher development velocity. Because it&amp;rsquo;s a script that will run every few minutes and then stop, RAM is less of an issue, and the official docker images https://hub.docker.com/_/python/ mean I don&amp;rsquo;t yet have to upgrade the ancient Ubuntu 18.04 on my VPS. Next thought was rather to spend this time writing. Zapier free tier is working fine for now, will get back to self-hosting it later. org-roam-node-find calls org-roam-node-read calls org-roam-node-read--completions calls org-roam-node-list, which always reads the full list of nodes from the sqlite database. Whyyyyy? When I do a semantic search using org-roam-similarity, I already have the small list of IDs. I only want to offer the user this small list, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to read the full list every time, and then remove everything except the list I already have &amp;ndash; so much wasted effort.
