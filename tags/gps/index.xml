By “noticed”, I of course mean “got super frustrated with and considered briefly throwing the gadget onto the ground and arranging for its utter disintegration through repeated jumping on it”.</p>
<p>Besides losing the first 0.5 km of my run data, the pacing information, delivered via synthesised voice, would be wildly inaccurate for the rest of my run.</p>
<p>Judging by <a href="https://us.community.samsung.com/t5/forums/v3_1/forumtopicpage/board-id/wearabletech/thread-id/464/page/1">this 22 page thread on the Samsung community forums</a>, there are other users who were also less than happy that the Gear Fit 2 built-in GPS does not seem to work as advertised. Understandably, people bought the gadget in order to be able to go running without having to lug their smartphones along.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it turns out the explanation is quite logical, although Samsung really has to do better to communicate this to their users.</p>
<h1 id="why-does-mygear-fit-2-take-so-long-to-acquirea-gps-lock">Why does my Gear Fit 2 take so long to acquire a GPS lock?</h1>
<p>In short, at the start of my run, my smartphone was lying on my desk one floor up. At that point the Gear Fit 2 still had a bluetooth connection to the phone, and it was planning to use the phone GPS instead of its built-in unit. As far as I know, the gadget’s use of the phone’s GPS is not well known.</p>
<p>As the distance between me and the office building increased, the Gear Fit 2 obviously lost the bluetooth connection to the smartphone. With the current firmware (R360XXU1BPL1 at the time of writing), it takes the Gear Fit 2 about 0.5 km to realise that the connection is really lost, and that it should switch to its built-in GPS.</p>
<p>This as all pretty logical, but highly frustrating when you don’t know what’s going on. Samsung clearly has to do better.</p>
<h1 id="the-fix">The Fix</h1>
<p>Knowing what the issue is makes the fix pretty straight-forward.</p>
<p>Before starting your run, disable bluetooth on your smartphone, and wait for the Gear Fit 2 to register loss of the connection. It should vibrate on your wrist, and then show a little rectangle at the top right of the display, like this:<figure id="attachment_2749" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2749" style="width: 184px" class="wp-caption alignnone"></p>

<p>You can now start the exercise app and then start your run.</p>
<p>This morning, my Gear Fit 2 acquired a GPS lock almost instantly. You can see this by <strong>the location icon which briefly flashes and then stays on</strong> (it’s very important that you ensure that it stays on before running off), and by the fact that the on-screen distance gauge (you only see the distance gauge if you have set a distance target) starts climbing immediately.</p>
<p>(Update: I’ve had more runs since. Sometimes the GPS struggles for half a minute or more to get a lock, with the location icon remaining in the flashing state. In these cases, I sometimes stop the run, and start over, until that damned flashing location icon goes stable. Frustrating.)</p>

<p>For the price, the Samsung Gear Fit 2 packs a lot of features.</p>
<p>However, between this undocumented (as far as I can see) and sometimes plain frustrating GPS behaviour, the voice guidance which breaks easily and mysteriously (see <a href="/2017/01/21/samsung-gear-fit-2-voice-guide-at-intervals-not-working-at-all-the-fix/">another post of mine on that issue and how to fix it</a>), and the battery life (a 40 minute run with music and GPS can use up 30% to 40% of the battery), slightly more serious casual runners (strange category, I know) might want to consider carefully their alternatives.</p>
