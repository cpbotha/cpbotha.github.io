As bottle designs go, this one is pretty metal:
Amongst a number of impressive-sounding statements, the back of the bottle concludes with:
Lumberjack has a sturdy malt driven backbone packed with loads of roasted malt. Huge hop additions intensify the piney-citrus aromas of this full flavoured ale. A beer for the brave.
After reading that, who does not want to drink this beer for the brave?</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>Jack Black brewery’s Lumberjack is an amber ale craft brewed in Cape Town. As bottle designs go, this one is pretty <em>metal</em>:</p>

<p>Amongst a number of impressive-sounding statements, the back of  the bottle concludes with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lumberjack has a sturdy malt driven backbone packed with loads of roasted malt. Huge hop additions intensify the piney-citrus aromas of this full flavoured ale. A beer for the brave.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After reading that, who does <em>not</em> want to drink this <strong>beer for the brave</strong>?! Based on extensive testing, I can report that this is indeed a full-bodied beer that deserves and rewards your full attention.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://blacksmithskitchen.co.za/">Blacksmith’s Kitchen</a> is a vineyard restaurant in Paarl. It looks like this:</p>

<p>The views from the outside tables are quite beautiful:</p>

<p>Weather permitting (which is very often in Paarl), this kitchen is absolutely worth a visit.</p>
