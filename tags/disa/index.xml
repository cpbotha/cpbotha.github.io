It’s definitely time to get out a Weekly Head Voices, so that we can all feel nicely up to date. This post covers the period from Monday December 5, 2016 to Sunday January 15, 2017, which is ever so slightly *cough* later than average.
My excuse is: SUMMER HOLIDAY.
If you have not yet read my 2016 to 2017 transition post, this is a gentle reminder to make some time to do so.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>WELL HELLO THERE FRIENDS FROM THE BLOGOSPHERE!</p>
<p>It’s definitely time to get out a Weekly Head Voices, so that we can all feel nicely up to date. This post covers the period from Monday December 5, 2016 to Sunday January 15, 2017, which is ever so slightly *cough* later than average.</p>
<p>My excuse is: SUMMER HOLIDAY.</p>
<p>If you have not yet read <a href="/2017/01/05/the-2016-to-2017-transition-post/">my 2016 to 2017 transition post</a>, this is a gentle reminder to make some time to do so. There’s some backyard philosophy in that post that you might find useful.</p>
<p><em>(The main reason for writing this post is to satisfy my NO-GAPS-BETWEEN-WEEKLY-HEAD-VOICES-DAMNIT OCD. I’ve added pretty pictures to help us get through it.</em></p>
<p><em>Godspeed fellow traveller!__)</em></p>
<h1 id="the-holiday-starts">The holiday starts</h1>
<p>Below is a photo I have quite surprisingly titled “A scene with a beach, the sea and some fluffy clouds in the brilliant blue sky”. The photo was taken on the beach at Boggomsbaai, a really small sea-side village on the East coast where we spent the first few days of our holiday.</p>
<p>Up ahead you can see the bustling metropole (well, it has one really expensive minimarket and an impressive gate) of Vleesbaai.

<h1 id="head-voices-review-surprise">Head Voices Review. SURPRISE!</h1>
<p>After the truly disappointing <a href="/2016/12/20/review-awei-a990-bl-wireless-sport-bluetooth-earphones-avoid/">final death of my Awei bluetooth headphones</a> whilst running on that very beach, I acquired the Samsung Level Link, a tiny bluetooth transceiver which can turn any old set of cheap wired earphones into bluetooth earphones! It looks like this:</p>

        /> </a>
</figure>

<p>After five or six runs with this device of trouble-free music listening whilst running (Flume’s Skin was the business until recently, but I’ve just switched to the Tron Legacy soundtrack by Daft Punk which I’m enjoying, although I’m missing some of the Underworld-esque dancing in the summer afternoon sunset feels; THEM FEELS), the <strong>Head Voices Review</strong> (we’re baaaa-aaaaack!) is currently considering the following <em>initial review</em>:</p>

<li>Samsung Level Link: AWESOME.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="surfing">Surfing</h1>
<p>Shortly before Christmas, some of our Dutch besties arrived for a good old fashioned swap-the-Dutch-winter-for-some-guilt-free-South-African-summer shenanigans.</p>
<p>It’s a treat being able to show visitors from our other home around our old and now new again home. This often makes me do things which I should have done a long time ago but kept on postponing due to less important matters getting in the way.</p>
<p>One such thing is taking surfing lessons.</p>
<p>Funny thing is, there’s a brilliant surfing school (<a href="http://www.surfschools.co.za/">Son in Strand</a>, in case you were wondering) which is just a 15 minute drive away.</p>
<p>Our instructor was fabulous, and we are now all surfers as you can see:

</p>
<h1 id="getting-high">Getting high</h1>
<p>Another favourite local pastime is getting high with friends. Below is a picture of one such occasion. We were only moderately high, in preparation for another planned expedition described further down, but the views were beautiful nonetheless.

<p>At this point I feel it is mention-worthy that a lion ate my hat later that day. Literally.</p>

<p>That other planned expedition I mentioned was an absolutely brilliant hike to the top of Table Mountain via <a href="http://www.southafrica.net/za/en/articles/entry/article-platteklip-gorge-hike">Platteklip Gorge</a>, also known as Platties around these parts.</p>
<p>Platties is the steepest (and probably quickest, if you’re fit enough) walking route up Table Mountain. We were at the starting point before 8 AM in the morning to avoid the morning heat, but it was already quite hot (probably about 25+, it was 30+ later).</p>
<p>The walk was exhilarating (I could almost hear my mitochondria gnashing their teeth), and the views from the top textbook-spectacular:

</figure>
</p>
<p>Shortly after having arrived at the top, I saw a man wearing only shorts who had sort of just ran up the mountain barefoot.</p>
<p>He did not rest, instead choosing to circle around a bush at the top and going straight down again.</p>
<p>Still barefoot.</p>
<p>Slap-slap-slap, I could hear his feet hit the rocks.</p>
<h1 id="the-beach">The Beach</h1>
<p>Taking a trip along the photogenic coast-hugging <a href="http://www.mountainpassessouthafrica.co.za/find-a-pass/western-cape/item/95-clarence-drive,-gordons-bay.html">Clarence Drive</a>, we stopped to pay a visit to Dappat se Gat, a sort-of-secret beach.</p>
<p>Once you wade through all the trash from the side of the road :( and cross over a bunch of rocks back in the direction of Gordon’s bay, you find yourself on a beautiful secluded beach with a cave or two.</p>
<p>One of the photos I took came out with suitably interesting shading:</p>








<figure><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_20161229_1857389.jpg">

        /> </a>
</figure>

<p>It was hard to ignore the extreme hipness of the young people lounging and playing on the beach as we tried but failed to blend in.</p>
<p>After a short hike (with the little ‘uns) up Leopard’s Kloof in Betty’s Bay a few days later, we were rewarded by scenes of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disa_uniflora">Disa Uniflora</a>, an orchid which is exceptionally exclusive to our little corner of the planet.</p>
<p>By the power of the internets, I present you with new, more grainy photos of this pretty flower growing peacefully right next to a waterfall:</p>

<p>In sharp contrast to last year when I welcomed the new year from the comfort of my bed and a book (hey man, some of us were gestating!), this year a significant number of us entered 2017 in Light Party Mode.</p>
<p>In fact, as the clock struck 00:00, we found ourselves on a rock formation in the sea, in the dark, with waves crashing around us. Pretty neat now that I think about it.</p>
<p>That reminds me, I did see for the first time fully <strong>bioluminescent waves</strong>! As each wave broke, the foam had a distinct green light. The fact that we were not able to film this (not enough photons) only served to make it more magical.</p>
<p>During the day we <em>were</em> able to try out them new-fangled smartphone high speed video functions, yielding pretty slow motion captures of crashing waves, such as this one:</p>

</div>
<h1 id="the-holiday-ends">The holiday ends</h1>
<p>For the last few work weeks of 2016, I could not help but notice that it was time for a vacation. I had to apply substantial amounts of raw will power (that is, buckling down, hard) every day to maintain my usual levels of production.</p>
<p>This vacation has been wonderful in the sense of causing total brain switch-off from day one. The surroundings definitely played a role in this, but for a large part I think it was due to the active holiday programme we pursued with our friends.</p>
<p>This, and previous experiences, further strengthen the observation that <strong>true rest and mental refreshment can be better accomplished by running up and down mountains, swimming in the sea and being generally really busy taking part in new experiences</strong>, rather than, you know, actually resting.</p>
<p>However, even after this holiday’s mental rejuvenation and renewed energy, I was still not completely happy with the (admittedly less than before the vacation) amount of will power that was required during the first days of work.</p>
<p>I remembered this to have been much easier in the old days.</p>
<p>Serendipitously, I read and more or less immediately <a href="/2017/01/09/deep-work-a-welcome-kick-in-the-butt/">absorbed Cal Newport’s Deep Work into my atoms</a> after my first week at work.</p>
<p>After two weeks of weaving more deepness into my work, it seems that this was indeed the missing piece of the will power puzzle.</p>
<p>Have fun friends! I hope to see you sooner rather than later.</p>
<p> </p>

It’s not that I have something complicated or difficult to tell you, it’s just that I was privy to three absolutely awesome weeks of vacation in an undisclosed location to the very far south of my current coordinates, during which I attained ultimate levels of relaxation that caused my brain to shut-down large parts of itself. The only parts that managed to remain online were those dedicated to slow living, appreciation of people and surroundings and, finally, deep thought. My brain is currently taking its sweet time to come fully online again.</p>
<p>Oh well.</p>
<p>I <em>did</em> bring you a photo of Disa Uniflora, a special little orchid that likes living close to little waterfalls, for example just like the one that can be found on your hike up Leopard’s Kloof. Look:

</p>
<p>As is usual for sunny vacations during which we transition into a new year, a number of realizations and resolutions slowly bubbled up to the surface from some usually submerged part of my consciousness. I’d like to share some of them with you:</p>
<p><em>Life goals are bad.</em> Let’s stop doing them. The problem is that humans are awesome at adaptation. Unfortunately this means that two days after having celebrated your latest epic life achievement, you’re bored with it. Some people even get bored with their lives in general, and then buy a leather jacket and a motorbike because they think that <em>that’ll</em> somehow solve the problem, only to get bored with their new image soon after. Fortunately, there is a way to sidestep the problem quite elegantly. Don’t set life goals, but rather set life directions. Instead of defining the point that you want to go towards, define your preferred direction. If you do it right, you’ll pass those points as you go along in any case, except you won’t land in the depressing goal vacuum right after reaching the point that you’ve been moving towards for so long, because you’re motoring along in a direction, and that’s what’s important. To those more mathematically inclined, ignore the life function, rather design its derivatives. This is a practical way of <em>applying</em> the well-known addage that life is about the journey, and not the destination.</p>
<p><em>Disconnecting is good.</em> I do love the internet. I also think it’s one of the most awesome achievements of the whole of humankind ever, and it really empowers humans everywhere. I’m more or less addicted to being constantly connected, having constant access to the sum total of human knowledge and in principle to a large percentage of my fellow humans. However, there is a fine line between having constant access and being constantly interrupted by too many not necessarily valuable packets of data. We’re very vulnerable to this latter situation, due to <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2009/08/seeking.html" title="slate article dealing with brain chemistry and internet interruption">our brain chemistry being optimized by all of evolution for novelty</a>, and for foraging, so we keep on clicking on “refresh”, and our ears perk up whenever a phone goes “ping”. However, when not being interrupted, human thought gets the room it needs to grow and deepen, into importance and into impact.</p>
<p>I’ve also been thinking about consumption. I’d like to do much less of that, and when I do, I’d prefer to consume quality. In my thoughts, it was primarily about information, but it applies to many other things. It’s an ongoing process.</p>
<p>I’m adding all of these to my growing list of little life tips. As regular readers of this blog, you know some of these by now: Keep on  <a href="/2011/08/28/the-lowlands-tooth-fairy-37-weekly-head-voices-55/" title="balance and harmony mentioned, has to bemore">striving for balance and harmony</a>, <a href="/2011/03/19/drown-in-the-now-weekly-head-voices-42/" title="drown in the now">focus on the now</a>, <a href="/2011/11/05/happiness-slingshot-weekly-head-voices-61/" title="create value">create value</a>, <a href="/2010/08/01/the-human-animal-post/" title="the human animal post">study your manual</a>, and, most importantly, <a href="/tag/coffee/" title="posts tagged with coffee">drink lots of coffee</a>. One day I’m going to combine them all nicely into the Unified Dogma of  Me (UDM) and then I’ll start a sect. Seriously though, it’s quite challenging keeping these and the other ones in the front of my mind all the time. The UDM would definitely help. And I could start a sect.</p>
<p>One more thing before you go: I came across <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/01/10/1115323109" title="Ratcliff 2012 in PNAS">this recent PNAS article</a> via the science pages of my newspaper. William Ratcliff and colleagues at the Michigan State University showed with a terribly simple experiment that single-celled yeast cells can evolve into multi-cellularity quite quickly. Pouring yeast from one test tube into another about 60 times, an action that favours, or selects, yeast cells that clump together, resulted into a multi-celled organism: The clumped together yeast cells started showing internal specialization. Pretty awesome results, especially considering the fact that you could probably reproduce this experiment in your kitchen.</p>
<p>That’s all for this week kids. Have fun evolving!</p>
