<p>My life seems to be just full of cowbell at the moment. During the coming months, more will be revealed. During the past weeks, the following things seemed mention-worthy at the time:</p>
<ul>
<li>On Sunday, April 17, I went with a posse consisting exclusively of spectacularly hip people, who prefer to remain anonymous on this blog but who might pop up in the comments now and then, to the <a href="http://www.last.fm/event/1897405+Coldcut+Energy+Union" title="last.fm page for the coldcut energy union gig in the melkweg">Coldcut Energy Union</a> gig in Amsterdam. As you will know, if you’re also unbearably cool, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja_Tune" title="ninja tune page on wikipedia">Ninja Tune</a> the record label is run by the same two dudes making up Coldcut. On this particular Sunday, Matt Black was doing the honours. He can certainly DJ, but unfortunately the performance was dominated by its green message, and much to its detriment. When I go to a gig, I really prefer not being preached to. Whatever the case may be, the presence of the spectacularly hip posse made for a fabulous night nonetheless.</li>
<li>Completely of my own accord (this was done on the Saturday BEFORE the coldcut gig) I have now changed to a <a href="http://www.greenchoice.nl/" title="greenchoice energy provider">green energy provider</a>. My household’s electricity quota is filled with exclusively wind and sun energy, and my gas usage is compensated for by lush forests in the Amazon. Coupled with my house’s 95% warmth efficiency (on heat-emission aerial photos, our whole neighbourhood appears to be completely dark) and my bicycle-addiction, I now have a license to be more snooty about environmental matters at parties, so there.</li>
<li>There are two job opportunities I would like to bring under your and your social network’s attention: The first is a well-paid Ph.D. position under my supervision here in Delft, working on the next generation modelling and visualisation required for the Virtual Surgical Pelvis. See the <a href="http://graphics.tudelft.nl/Vacancies/EWI2011.02" title="VSP PhD position website">VSP vacancy website</a> for all the details. If you don’t feel like getting a Ph.D., or you already have one, but you still want to work on visualisation and bio-mechanical modelling, you could do much worse than apply for <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Motek-Medical-job-opening-for-Software-Application-Developer.pdf" title="motek medical job description">this software application developer</a> position at <a href="/2009/09/13/weekly-head-voices-3-powerless-meat-zen-xi-leaves-nfbi-motek/" title="previous blog post about motek">Motek Medical</a> under the supervision of my good friend <a href="http://nl.linkedin.com/in/franssteenbrink" title="linkedin page frans steenbrink">Frans Steenbrink</a>, who is an alround kickass-type but still doesn’t have his own website or blog.</li>
<li>I made a nice MobiPocket / Kindle version (that’s an ebook, you caveman) of the latest available web-version of the Django Book 2.0, and then I wrote <a href="http://vxlabs.com/2011/04/25/the-django-book-2-0-in-mobipocket-kindle-format/" title="vxlabs blog post about djangobook 2.0 ebook">a geeky blog post</a> about it.</li>
<li>Beautiful easter weather made for some stunning outings, such as an early-morning visit to the Delftse Hout and to a café called Knus (“cozy”):

</ul>
<p>That’s about it for the mentionables. It seems that the good weather has a significant effect on the frequency and length of my blog posts, which I interpret as a positive sign. What’s not so positive, is that I really like this helmet (found via <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/04/22/sa-photonics-high-res-digital-night-vision-system-makes-you-look/" title="engadget article with night vision helmet">engadget</a>):
