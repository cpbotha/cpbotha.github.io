<p>There is a nerd joke I could make about using a single byte to store the WHV post number, which would explain the long stretch of time between this edition and the previous one in March, itself also lamenting the growing interval between posts, but I&rsquo;m not going to.</p>
<p>Instead, I would like to welcome you to this, the 255th edition of the Weekly Head Voices, a mere 6.5 months after the previous one.</p>
<p>On a more serious note, my reasons for almost never posting anymore, relative to years of averaging about one WHV every two weeks, are a mix of just being really busy with family, friends and work, and of realising that suddenly I have become quite old in terms of wall clock time.</p>
<p>Whist I <em>feel</em> young, and apart from <a href="/tags/cancer">a cancer or two</a> I am in pretty good health, in my head the WHV used to originate from the head of a much younger human.</p>
<p>This gave these posts a certain <em>flavour</em> of youthful optimism, perhaps blamelessness, or maybe we should just keep it at youthful <em>je ne sais quoi</em>. These thoughts subsequently graduated <em>summa cum laude</em> from the University of Analysis Paralysis, and so months of no blogging ensued.</p>
<p>As my thoughts did not stop thoughting, fortunately, but more probably because with advancing age some of us acquire the super power of realising how few f***s we have left to give, I&rsquo;m feeling increasingly less awkward about posting my Weekly Head Voices here again.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Because I&rsquo;ve always liked for the WHVs to have full calendar coverage of my life, the rest of this post is a collection of noteworthy happenings and observations from my perspective, covering the period from April 1 to Sunday, November 17, 2024.</p>
<h2 id="i-turned-50">I turned 50</h2>
<p>In August, I completed my 50th ride around the sun.</p>
<p>I am truly an old guy now.</p>
<p>Somehow I still managed to convince myself otherwise during the whole of my 40s, but now there is no escaping.</p>
<p>22:00 is really late to go to bed. In the mornings, I am unable to see my phone screen without my spectacles. I am now at the age where I have to start being really careful about not falling. You just don&rsquo;t heal like you used to.</p>
<p>On the other hand, thanks to my family and to my friends, I am deeply and blissfully content.</p>
<p>The first of my kids is finishing with high school and going to university. Conversations about life partners and careers and families and grand kids are not uncommon. On that topic, many conversations with my children are epic. They are growing up to be such beautiful humans, and we are happy to be here to help them in their journeys.</p>
<p>P.S. It is no accident that my <a href="/2024/01/04/the-2023-to-2024-transition-post/#life-systems-2024">personal values</a> include more than one entry focusing on children, family and friends.</p>
<p>P.P.S. The South African edition of my birthday party took the form of an outdoorsy weekend with some of my favourite people. The Cinque Terre-themed party on Saturday ended at 2 or 3 AM with Tool on the dance floor. Weekend parties are the best parties.</p>
<h2 id="brilliant-dutchie-reunion-in-august">Brilliant Dutchie reunion in August</h2>
<p>As part of my birthday celebration, I travelled for a weekend party with some of my Dutch family in August.</p>
<p>The weekend started with a fabulous visit to my friend and mentor FP and his partner AW right after landing on Thursday, by the end of which my long travels were in fact already worth it.</p>
<p>My subsequent short visit to Delft (my other home) was nostalgic and a bit magical (see photo above), and then, as per tradition, we were off to spend the rest of the weekend at <a href="/tags/lowlands/">Lowlands</a>.</p>
<p>Musically I was utterly satisfied with Soulwax, Skrillex (guest appearance Noisia!), Fred Again&hellip; and many more, but the vibe with my friends was the uncontested headliner. It does also need to be said that we were somehow able to keep the intensity up until the very last act, until the fat lady sang.</p>
<p>For those of you who were there with me, I would like to apologise, but I was applying the following advice at 120%:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You’ve got to dance like nobody’s watchin’</p>
<p>&ndash; <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2014/02/02/dance/">Susanna Clark and Richard Leigh</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>P.S. When you&rsquo;re at a music festival, having more than one (or two&hellip;) mimosas with breakfast is not just allowed, but strongly encouraged!</p>
<h2 id="gou-1-turned-18">GOU#1 turned 18</h2>
<p>Throughout the years, Genetic Offspring Unit #1 aka GOU#1 has made a number of <a href="/tags/gou-1/">implicit appearances on this blog</a>.</p>
<p>Some of you have known her since she was just a baby.</p>
<p>A few months ago, she completed another ride around the sun and all of a sudden we have an 18 year old young adult!</p>
<p>GOU#1 has a sharp intellect, she loves people, and she has a preternatural talent for being in the moment, a state she cognitively understands.</p>
<p>I really love our discussions. A bit surprisingly, she is a dad joke connoisseur.</p>
<p>I have often told her that she will overtake me, both mentally and physically, which will mean that I have done my job.</p>
<p>My wish is that she will continue on her great trajectory. I have told her that I think she has figured a lot out about life, but that I will be there to remind her, if and when it&rsquo;s necessary.</p>
<p>GOU#1, maybe one day you will read this. I am a huge fan of your work. ❤️</p>
<h2 id="blom-bullet-list-of-miscellany">BLoM: Bullet List of Miscellany</h2>
<h3 id="omnivore-is-no-more">Omnivore is no more</h3>
<p>In WHV #254 (you know, all the way back in March of this year), I <a href="/2024/03/31/weekly-head-voices-254-ratio/#omnivore">recommended the read-it-later app Omnivore</a> to you.</p>
<p>It was such a great app, but I should have known better and I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>They were bought by elevenlabs, and all users had two weeks to export their data.</p>
<p>This was (yet) another lesson to me that I should never deviate from <a href="/2023/04/11/note-taking-strategy-2023/#high-level-overview">characteristic (requirement) #2 of my note-taking systems</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As far as possible, the canonical source of everything should be plain old files on local drives, and be synchronized with a tool like Dropbox or OneDrive. In this way, the system is robust to the whims of a note-taking SaaS. The litmus test for this is that you are able to change out sync services and still remain with a working system. (True story)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After drying off my tears, I dusted off <a href="/2011/10/09/hell-yeah-weekly-head-voices-59/">my trusty old Zotero</a> config, noticed that the girls and boys of Zotero had been <em>really</em> busy making the software even better, and now I&rsquo;m using this for web page archiving and highlighting in addition to the academic article database duties I was already using it for.</p>
<p>It turns out there are fantastic tools with which you can import Zotero highlights from web-pages <em>and</em> academic articles into your Obsidian notes. See <a href="https://vxlabs.com/2024/11/02/template-for-zotero-obsidian-plugin-to-import-references-with-highlights/">my vxlabs post on the topic</a>.</p>
<h3 id="there-is-a-til-section-on-my-other-website">There is a TiL section on my other website</h3>
<p>On the topic of Obsidian, and as part of my quest to reduce any friction preventing me from posting technical documentation, my profile website now has a <a href="https://charlbotha.com/til/"><em>Today I Learned</em> aka TIL section</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to the magic of <a href="https://charlbotha.com/til/Setup-Quartz-to-publish-single-Obsidian-folder">Obsidian and the Quartz publishing tool</a>, I can now publish a random technical note in minutes.</p>
<p>I would have to say that it&rsquo;s not just a technical friction reducer, it&rsquo;s also the idea of having a space where you encourage yourself to post work that is not worthy of blog post quality, but could be valuable to someone regardless.</p>
<p>All of that being said, in the WHV-break I did manage to publish nine (9) technical posts on <a href="https://vxlabs.com/">vxlabs.com</a>. Underlining my point above, some of the vxlabs posts sucked up more preparation time than their content deserved, and conversely there were probably a few short tidbits that never saw the light of day.</p>
<h3 id="bluesky-is-my-new-micro-blogging-thing-of-choice">Bluesky is my new micro-blogging thing of choice</h3>
<p>In the past few days (from November 12), the micro-blogging service Bluesky has grown from 14 million to 18 million users, with about 10 million monthly active users at the time of writing.</p>
<p>Although Bluesky and its underlying AT Protocol (aka <a href="https://atproto.com/">atproto</a>) have been designed to be distributed (users can for example already set up a PDS server to host their own data), that is not the reason I am preferring this micro-blogging service over all others.</p>
<p>My main reason is that it seems that many users on Bluesky, maybe even most, currently prefer a more supportive and positive environment in which one can connect with other humans and perhaps even have fun together.</p>
<p>Conversely, people who prefer being unkind can go do so elsewhere. Bluesky&rsquo;s nuclear block and other tools enable users to control exactly what sorts of interactions they have, and many are choosing for friendly interactions.</p>
<p>In short, it almost looks like people there are preferring kindness.</p>
<p>I might write more about this in future, but this is absolutely what I would prefer spending my dwindling time on: Contributing to an environment where humans are kind to other kind humans. I really hope that Bluesky can stay true to this ideal.</p>
<h3 id="databricks-and-spark">Databricks and Spark</h3>
<p>This section almost did not make it in, but I feel like I should at least mention it here, because it took up a substantial share of my work time the past months.</p>
<p>We are upgrading our data engineering infrastructure at work. As part of this, I have <em>really</em> been enjoying learning about and applying Databricks and the underlying Apache Spark and Delta Lake tech to our data architecture.</p>
<p>You can AMA, but for now I think Databricks is a fantastic product that is not too expensive, and gives you plenty of ways to work with your data even when you don&rsquo;t want to switch on that sweet Databricks compute.</p>
<h2 id="the-end-my-friend">The end my friend</h2>
<p>Friends, thank you for joining me here again!</p>
<p>I really hope that I can come back here to share more of my old person life tips, because, you know:</p>

<li>Unexpectedly enjoyable little run at 7:27 in Land en Zeezicht (Beaumont school district), just after dropping off GOU#3, and just before the dailry heatwave hit. On Reservoir Road, close to the end of my route, I looked up at the beautiful clouds and experienced a feeling of what I can only describe as <a href="/2022/05/23/weekly-head-voices-242-multiplicity-of-me/#multiplicity-of-you">inside-is-outside connected bliss</a>.</li>
<li>Made 40 seconds recording of my talking head in English, translated it to Spanish using <a href="https://www.heygen.com/">HeyGen</a>. I used the resultant video for a short GenAI update at work. Really funny but also a bit scary to see my mouth (in my face) talking Spanish in such convincing fashion.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="saturday-2024-02-03">Saturday 2024-02-03</h2>
<ul>
<li>New licence, requested on Wednesday, delivered into my hands!</li>
<li>Against all the odds, and also in an utterly surprising (to me) move, four of us (3 NL, 1 ZA) have <a href="https://lowlands.nl/">Lowlands 2024</a> tickets. I was not planning to go this year, but friend MG got me back in the programme with a few well-placed Signal messages, casually mentioning that Skrillex was on the line-up (noooooo), and as if that was not enough, Fred Again and Soulwax too (unable&hellip;to&hellip;.resist). The crew will not be as complete as last year, which was why I was planning to sit on the bench this year, but life is short and I miss my friends.
<ul>
<li>I say against all the odds, because <a href="https://festileaks.com/2024/02/lowlands-2024-in-rap-tempo-uitverkocht/">all 60000+ tickets were sold out in 20 minutes</a>. We were in the digital queue together with 130000 other customers (each customer can buy up to 8 tickets!), but we eventually got the message that all tickets had been sold out, indeed after about 20 minutes. We did what many folks apparently do not: We just kept on trying! Looks like the odd ticket, probably from a failed payment, made its way back to the queue, and we managed to buy 1+2+1 by just not giving up.</li>
<li>Now I am equal parts ecstatic and daunted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sunday-2024-02-04">Sunday 2024-02-04</h2>
<ul>
<li>13km run in the heat. Was planning for shorter, but run was much more fun than I expected, just super hot man.</li>
<li>Through an email from familysearch.org, saw that someone had uploaded scans of the &ldquo;Doop register NG Kerk Worcester&rdquo; all the way outta 1881, through which I could confirm some of my earlier findings (after a long search) re my <a href="https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:6K5Q-5KJ8">great-grandfather Pieter Barend Francois, born in 1881</a>, namely that his dad was Daniël Stephanus Botha born born 1848. Thanks familysearch and thanks Church!
<ul>
<li>You might remember that myheritage was an important part of how I learned that I&rsquo;m actually an Appel straight outta Dutchieland (my home away from home) and not a real Botha. See <a href="/2022/02/03/weekly-head-voices-237-dont-step-over-the-thing/#the-apple-doesn-t-fall-far-from-the-tree">WHV #237</a>.</li>
<li>However, I don&rsquo;t want to renew my myheritage.com sub in February. In spite of their 20% discount offer, it&rsquo;s really quite expensive if it&rsquo;s just hosting my data. It was definitely worth it when I was still actively trying to track down various ancestors.</li>
<li>Now I have to start looking for alternative tools to maintain our family tree. I know about gramps, but tonight I discovered ancestris, which works natively with GEDCOM (not just import and export).</li>
</ul>
</li>

<h2 id="running">Running</h2>
<p>My running habit has been steadily returning to its pre-op state, both in terms of
fitness but, more importantly, in terms of joy.</p>
<p>Also, my sixth pair of Altra Escalantes (version 3.0) recently arrived. I
wanted black ones, as I usually recycle old Altras after their recommended
700km or so into super comfortable office shoes, but my supplier was out of
stock and so I ended up with these surprisingly attractive blue and red ones:</p>

<p>In more good news, it turns out that it&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/news/20230719/your-heart-benefits-even-if-you-exercise-as-a-weekend-warrior">entirely OK if you spend all of your
minimum of 2.5 weekly hours of exercise during the weekend</a>.</p>
<p>Personally, I usually manage to fit in two shorter runs during the week, and a
longer run during the weekend, for a desired total of 25km per week, but I have
always wondered if it was in fact required to exercise on every day of the week
for maximal health benefit.</p>
<p>P.S. My main motivation is the unqualified joy of the run and not so much the
health benefits, although the benefits sure are nice!</p>
<p>P.P.S. <a href="/2023/01/01/the-2022-to-2023-transition-post/#running">25km per week was my resolution for 2023</a>, but that plan was quite rudely
torpedoed by my <a href="/2023/07/01/weekly-head-voices-252-prostate-cancer/">prostate cancer adventure a few months ago</a>, so now I just try
to make it week by week.</p>
<h2 id="genai">GenAI</h2>
<p>For the past months, I&rsquo;ve been going deeper and deeper into generative AI, and
more specifically large language models (LLMs), down to the nuts and bolts and
let&rsquo;s-get-Llama-2-70-billion-quantized-and-running-on-my-PC levels.</p>
<p>Here are a few things that I really liked learning about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Although it has indeed been a longer journey, the current GenAI explosion /
hype seems to have been ignited in the third quarter of 2022, with the open
source release of Stable Diffusion in August, and the birth of ChatGPT in
November.</li>
<li>For the largest part, the most powerful LLMs have been trained, on hundreds
of billions to trillions of words, how to predict the next / missing word of
an incomplete document. After enough of this, they appear to gain some sort
of reasoning capability, including being able to answer theory of mind
questions.
<ul>
<li>There are striking similarities to how humans interpret speech.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Almost all of the currently famous models (Stable Diffusion, Whisper, all
current LLMs) are based on a specific type of neural network called a
Transformer, introduced in the paper <em>Attention Is All You Need</em>, published by
Ashish Vaswani and fellow Google researchers in 2017.</li>
</ul>
<p>For many more details about these, and other hopefully interesting
observations, please come to one of my GenAI talks!</p>
<p>GenAI developments are continuing at a truly impressive pace, and now I hope
that we (personally) can also start showing some practical and useful
applications!</p>
<p>P.S. Read the brilliant Lyn Alden&rsquo;s latest newsletter <a href="https://www.lynalden.com/august-2023-newsletter/">Six AI Themes to Consider</a>
in which she discusses how AIs (actually LLMs) are already starting to use
bitcoin (lightning) to pay for services (soon other AIs and also humans) in
order to complete their tasks.</p>
<h2 id="lowlands-2023">Lowlands 2023</h2>
<p>One could say that the WHV series owes its life to a certain 3-day festival in
the Netherlands as <a href="/2009/08/29/starting-today-head-voices-every-week/">it was born in the sweet afterglow of the 2009 edition</a>.</p>
<p>However, due to the strict WHALLSALL privacy policy, you will find only
<a href="/tags/lowlands/">pleasant echoes of the experience</a> in a number of posts on this blog.</p>
<p>This time it felt even more special, because it&rsquo;s the first time that I was
able to go since <a href="/2019/09/01/weekly-head-voices-176-cycle-of-life/">all the way back in 2019</a>.</p>
<p>I was pleasantly shocked by the warm <em>familiarity</em> of my other home, starting all
the way from the airport in Cape Town, joining hundreds of Dutchies returning
home after their vacations in SA, to arriving in NL and letting that lovely
language permeate my neural network, all through the festival chaos and
sometimes extremely close proximity to tens of thousands of locals, to walking
and cycling under the late summer sun, to spending the highest possible quality
time with my friends there.</p>
<p>Again I am left overflowing with gratitude.</p>
<p>Thank you other home, and eternal thank you friends!</p>
<h2 id="i-am-a-function">I am a function</h2>
<p>Back in <a href="/2014/05/07/weekly-head-voices-70-patterns-in-the-sand/">WHV #70 from 2014</a>, based on some reading about the turnover of matter
in humans, I came to the following conclusion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now I see us all as nothing more than the continuously changing patterns that
form briefly in the grains of sand of the universe. Winds blow grains of sand
around, now taking part in one pattern and then in another. At some point, your
body has contained parts of your best friend, and of your worst enemy. The
patterns change continually; sometimes they fade away, and sometimes new
patterns emerge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the intervening years, reader KvG first introduced me to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Watts">Alan Watts</a>, noting
that they saw similar themes in our writing.</p>
<p>I am wording it carefully here, as I obviously can&rsquo;t really compare my backyard
philosophical attempts to the work of Alan Watts, which I have now come to know
better.</p>
<p>That story was required to bring us to this, the concluding quote of this post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are a function of what the whole universe is doing in the same way that a
wave is a function of what the whole ocean is doing. &ndash; Alan Watts</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I really love that.</p>

<p>This period had more than its fair share of lows and highs.</p>
<h2 id="loss">Loss.</h2>
<p>On Saturday, August 3 we lost one of our clan mothers, quite unexpectedly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to find the words to describe the sudden <em>emptiness</em> left behind by
a loved one.</p>
<p>It was a painful reminder of how much of our experience, and of our <em>selves</em>,
are built upon our bonds with those around us.</p>
<p>It was also a reminder of how much more deliberately and intently we should
dive into and <em>merge</em> with the atoms of each and every moment that we get to
spend with our fellow humans.</p>
<h2 id="reunion">Reunion.</h2>
<p>This year I again had the exquisite pleasure of bringing a short summer visit
to my Dutch family.</p>
<p>Although I sometimes wish that I had eidetic memory so that I could savour this
experience more accurately, I do seem to be looking back at a perfect few days.</p>
<p>The weather was typically Dutch: a tad grey, with some rain now and then. So
when the sun made a brief appearance now and then, our enjoyment was only
intensified.</p>
<p>Each hour and each minute was squeezed for every drop of experience and
togetherness that it had to offer.</p>
<p>Each moment was filled to the brim with our shared <em>humanness</em>.</p>
<p>Dutch family if you are reading this: Thank you.</p>

<figcaption> At this specific moment, the legend that is Giorgio Moroder was
taking us on a trip through his, and our, musical history. We were stationed, not
altogether statically, on one of the upper floors of the Terrazia across from
the Heineken, experiencing one of those exquisitely perfect summer festival
moments.

</figure>
<p>P.S. The <a href="/2009/08/29/starting-today-head-voices-every-week/">Weekly Head Voices series was <em>born</em> in the afterglow of Lowlands
2009</a>.</p>
<h2 id="celebration">Celebration.</h2>
<p>Somewhere during the past three weeks I added another birthday to my scarily
growing collection.</p>
<p>When I woke up on the relevant weekend morning, I had made the deliberate
decision to fill the day with as many as possible of my favourite things.</p>
<p>So:</p>
<p>I started the day with a run.</p>
<p>You would probably not say it if you looked at my running frequency over the
last few weeks (&ldquo;winter weather&rdquo; is all I can say), but this is definitely one
of my favourite activities ever. (I just checked: It seems I have now racked up
just over 1000km on sandals, and about 200km on bare feet.)</p>
<p>After that, I cooked up some pretty respectable Indian cuisine for my <em>inner</em>
circle, that is: genetic progenitor, genetic co-offspring (sibling man, you
have to keep up!), genetic offspring units and life partners.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something really special about having one&rsquo;s peeps at the kitchen table
with good wine while one, also armed with some of the aforementioned good wine,
does one&rsquo;s best not to embarrass the recipe one has meticulously selected for
the occasion.</p>
<p>(In this case the journey was great, and even the dhal-based destination was
nothing to sneeze at!)</p>
<p>Finally, I made a point of getting out at least one blog post. It turned out to
be <a href="https://vxlabs.com/2019/08/25/format-flowed-with-long-lines/">a fairly technical
job</a>, but it
checked the relevant box.</p>
<p>As I was working through the list, my real-time life satisfaction meter (what
do you mean you don&rsquo;t have one?) soon became stuck at the 12/10 mark, at which
point I just stopped looking and focused everything I have on the people. 🤗</p>

<p>Shortly after returning from NL, my year counter ticked over one more time.</p>
<p>I have become indeed <em>quite</em> middle-aged.</p>
<p>On the flip side, I am content with where I find myself in space-time, both physically and meta-physically. Although I seem to think more slowly, I do seem to have become slightly better at retrospection, introspection and at <a href="/2016/05/22/weekly-head-voices-107-balance/">seeing the bigger picture</a>.</p>
<p>As an additional consolation, it seems that I am in the best physical condition I have been for years due to a recent(ish) and surprising discovery of a latent jogging addiction. I am terrible at the action itself, but I really enjoy being repeatedly terrible at it.</p>
<p>On the topic of consolation, I tasted (at least) three new local craft beers, the experience of which I would like to share with you.</p>

<p>The Striped Horse Pils won gold at the 2015 and <a href="http://brewmistress.co.za/winners-of-the-2016-south-african-national-beer-trophy/">2016 National Beer Trophy</a>. More importantly, it also won the WHV-two-voices-cheering-loudly award, because it’s a full-bodied hoppy beer.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jackblackbeer.com/#atlantic-weiss">Jack Black Atlantic Weiss</a> gets a whopping 9.8 on <a href="/2016/08/15/weekly-head-voices-111-a-swift-hack/">my famous Celis White scale</a>. This is the lighter, fresher version of the Bone Crusher that we’ve all been waiting for. Now you just have to cross your fingers that more suppliers will get this. At this moment, it’s still quite tricky to track down.</p>
<p>On a subsequent failed mission to acquire more Atlantic Weiss, I ran into the Newlands Spring Brewing Company’s <em>Mountain Weiss</em>. As I was enjoying this light white beer (THE SUMMER IS COMING) something was tugging at the edge of my memory…</p>
<p>As I turned the bottle around, my worst suspicions were confirmed: Newlands Spring Brewing Company belongs to South African Breweries (SAB), the behemoth beer-brewing international mega-corp. They’ve been trying to get into the craft beer market, a sector traditionally belonging to often entrepreneurial and even family-run small enterprises, and this was their sneaky attempt.</p>
<p>In spite of its lovely taste, I do prefer spending my craft beer budget on mom-and-pop setups. Besides the truly tasty beer, I really like that craft beer has democratised a traditionally closed (by SAB!) area of commerce, and so would prefer putting my money there.</p>
<p>(That is not to say that I don’t buy SAB’s non-craft beers. A man gets thirsty!)</p>
<p>The following marvelous animation <a href="https://twitter.com/WorldAndScience/status/795747812424216576">popped up in my twitter timeline</a>:</p>

<p>Someone configured their camera stabilisation to lock on to the milky way in this National Geographic timelapse video. The result of this simple experiment is that you can clearly see the rotation of the Earth.</p>
<p>It’s really amazing what you can achieve by simply changing your perspective.</p>
<p>In Other Much More Important News, one of my last academic children <a href="http://noeskasmit.com/defended-phd-thesis-virtual-surgical-pelvis-anatomy-visualization-education-surgical-planning/">got doctorified on October 31</a>. I left academia for entirely non-children-related reasons (the children were the best part of academia!) <a href="http://noeskasmit.com/my-phd-supervisor-left-me/">shortly after she started with her doctorate</a>, hence the significance of this.</p>
<p>Henceforth, everyone has to add an extra DOCTOR to her already impressive title, namely <a href="https://twitter.com/eagereyes/status/793107701400162305">Evil Empress of the SciVis Galaxy</a>. Doctor Evil Empress of the SciVis Galaxy will continue her reign from her new (iron?) throne in the Visualization Group at the University of Bergen, Norway.</p>
<p>Don’t worry puny subjects, you are in good hands!</p>
<p>I read somewhere that good stories tend to make circles (could anyone help me out with a good reference?), so let me end this thing with a brilliantly coloured but slightly more lonesome sunset:</p>

I am eternally grateful to Twitter user @ftrain for granting us this gift. In the process, I also learnt that:
Twitter automatically transcodes animated GIFs to MP4s to save bandwidth, and for other reasons. I’m in two minds about this, because these are good reasons, but GIFs are really handy to be able to paste into HipChat and Slack and everywhere else. There is no real consensus concerning the pronunciation of GIF. The author of the format says JIF, a whole bunch of (vocal) other people say GIF. This is our last week in this house. It was a beautiful base for our return to South Africa, but the time has come to move on to a new home and to new memories. Moving out of places is decidedly not my favourite state of being.

<p>This is our last week in this house.

I think I might still be traumatized by the <a href="http://cpbotha.net/2013/12/14/on-leaving-the-netherlands/">experience of moving out of our Dutch hood</a>.</p>
<p>This weekend, <a href="http://dewijnrecensent.nl/">TPN</a> and more of my friends were at <a href="http://cpbotha.net/2011/08/28/the-lowlands-tooth-fairy-37-weekly-head-voices-55/">Lowlands</a>, my church. They’re still there, as I write this. I’ve been enjoying the experience through their photos and messages. You see, this is the first time in a number of years that I’m not there. My head, on the other hand, felt like it was more there than here this weekend. Nostalgia really is quite bitter-sweet.</p>

<p>I somehow only just now learnt that you can do this with Python:</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-python"><span style="color: #DFAF8F;">x_inside</span> = x_min &lt;= x &lt;= x_max
</pre>
</div>
<p>It <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-comp_operator">turns out</a> that in Python comparisons can be chained arbitrarily.</p>
<p>To those of you who’ve met me in person (that’s both of you I guess) it’s probably no surprise that my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator">Myers–Briggs Type Indicator</a> is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENTJ">ENTJ</a>. Someone tweeted <a href="http://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2015/05/the-definition-of-hell-for-each-myers-briggs-personality-type/">this page which defines hell for each of the MBTI types</a>. Mine reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ENTJ – Somebody is wrong, and they’re directing a large group of people! You can’t do anything about it and will have to obey whatever inefficient policies they decide to implement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I mention this, because this week I again fell into the trap, <em>and</em> broke my personal rule, of correcting someone who was wrong on the internet (it was about bicarbonate of soda and cancer). Of course this did not end well, although I managed to extract myself before it went completely off the rails.</p>
<p>It also made me think about why the internet, in spite of being one of the most wonderful things humankind has ever come up with, is so conducive to anti-social behaviour. You only have to take one look at the average comments section of a news site (news24, I’m looking at you), or at something even more toxic like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamergate_controversy">this</a>, to lose all hope in your fellow humans.</p>
<p>It turns out that we have a name for this: It’s called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_disinhibition_effect">online disinhibition effect</a>. It comes down to the fact that otherwise relatively normal people turn into anti-social gits when given anonymity (i.e. no consequences) and an audience. Penny Arcade dubbed this phenomenon the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny_Arcade#.22Greater_Internet_Fuckwad_Theory.22">Greater Internet F*ckwad Theory</a> and published <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/S=0/comic/2004/03/19">this handy graphical guide</a>. What I take from this, is that it is an <em>especially</em> good idea not to break the no-correcting-wrong-people-on-the-internet rule when the person in question is not posting under their real identity. Also, I really wish that we would grow up now.</p>
<p>Our week ended very much away from the digital world with a delightful and lazy Sunday lunch with great friends at <a href="http://www.longtable.co.za/">Long Table restaurant</a> on Haskell Vineyards just outside of Stellenbosch. The food was divine: Moroccan beef carpaccio starter, beautifully prepared Kob mains, followed by pecan nut praline cheese cake for dessert. As one does around these parts, the view was also something to drink in:</p>

<p>I turned 37 very recently. This is the last prime number I’ll have the privilege of gracing before shooting past the big four-oh. I remember when I turned 32. Amongst other defects which I believe I’ve gotten more or less under control, I was extremely <em>smug</em>, and I would probably have irritated the living daylights out of 37-year-old me. I’ve been very much desmugged in my search for harmony and balance in life, although I’ve been told that I tend to be self-congratulatory, an observation that I personally think might have been triggered by my extroverted optimism. Whatever the case may be, I’ll take 5 more years to de-self-congratulatorise myself as well. It’s really a small price to pay for harmony with the universe.</p>
<p>On my birthday, many wonderful people left sweet messages on my facebook wall, in my email inbox, in my SMS whatever and even to my face. It can’t be understated what a positive experience this was. Thank you wonderful people.</p>
<h3 id="two">Two</h3>
<p>I had the awesome privilege and unbridled pleasure (when last did you read about <em>unbridled pleasure</em> in a blog post?! hmm?) of spending 3 sunny days at <a href="http://lowlands.vpro.nl/2011/" title="vpro lowlands 2011 site">Lowlands 2011</a>, an alternative reality where it’s sunny (if you were in NL this “summer”, you would know that sunny weather is a purely theoretical concept) and you get to hang around on the grass drinking beer or in tents <em>experiencing</em> <a data-rel="lightbox-video-0" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWai4UZ0OqI" title="snippets from Amon Tobin's ISAM">Amon Tobin doing ISAM</a>, or <a data-rel="lightbox-video-1" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y81nowQ_MU" title="shuffle a dream by little dragon">Little Dragon being absolutely gorgeous</a> on Sunday morning, or Trentemöller and his band being superbly Danish. Of course you get to do this with a group of Exceptionally Wonderful People (EWPs). There is one thing you should take into account before starting to hang out with EWPs: They attract even more EWPs, resulting in huge groups of like-minded EWPs that renders linking up with your favourite EWPs (a subset of the larger group) an interesting challenge, further complicated by the fact that 65000 people SMSing at the same time in the middle of nowhere tend to clog up the few available cellphone towers, which in turn delays any SMS by a random amount from a few seconds to a few hours.</p>
<p>Whatever the case may be, I had an awesome time and am already very quietly counting down until August 2012. EWPs, get ready!</p>
<h3 id="three">Three</h3>
<p>Genetic Offspring #1 lost her first milk tooth and this is of course a major life event. So the Tooth Fairy, or the Tooth Mouse as we call it (GO#1 has ascertained that fairies don’t exist, but she has visually confirmed that mice in fact do, so she’s willing to play along for now), or actually just Yours Truly, had to sneak into her bedroom and exchange said tooth for a sizeable (compared to what my teeth went for back in the day) amount of cash. Remember that this is her major life event, but I did spend a few moments pondering the fact that <em>I’m now someone else’s Tooth Fairy</em>. That’s just huge man…</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>That’s (almost) all I have to say kids. This is my fourth blog post of
the weekend: I also wrote one on <a href="http://blog.timescapers.com/2011/08/27/django-nose-selenium-a-concise-tutorial/" title="timescapers blog post on django testing with selenium">Django testing with selenium</a>, one on

<p>I really liked writing them all, but I enjoyed this one the most.</p>

I’m truly sorry that you’ve had to endure three full weeks without any Head Voices. I’ve been in full-on Crisis Mode(tm) for the past weeks, doing my best to complete a number of projects, most prominent of which has been the brand-spanking new TU Delft first year CS course TI 1100-a. During Crisis Mode, all but the most critical of tasks have to spend some time on the back-burner. Almost like the adrenaline-fueled mammalian fight-or-flight response, when even one’s digestion is temporarily halted in order to divert all energy to for example bounding over trees whilst evading some sharp-toothed predator, even my GTD processing more or less came to a stand-till. TNR’s pomodoro suggestion, however, was a life-saver. There’s nothing like a succession of 25 minute periods of being completely in the zone for flattening mountains of work. If you’re not continuously zoning yet, I can’t more firmly recommend giving this a try.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>Dearest readers,</p>

<p>In any case, here I am, a slightly debauched weekend drawing to a close (thank you L and friends!), joyfully writing a special anniversary Weekly Head Voices.

<p><a href="http://graphics.tudelft.nl/Courses/TI1100A" title="TI 1100-a website">TI 1100-a</a> (which I plan to write a detailed blog post about; the short version: All TU Delft CS first years spend their whole first week doing a single project-oriented course, which I, with much help from my friends, completely redesigned during the past months) concluded with, as far as I could surmise, some success. Fifteen groups of enthusiastic students demonstrated fifteen working augmented reality music instruments in a room packed with 140+ people, and much fun was had by all. With this more or less concluded, I still have more than enough to do, but the decrease in shoulder-weight is considerable and very welcome.</p>
<p>Reaching slightly further back in time to a different slightly debauched weekend, I was one of the 55000 exceptionally privileged human beings spending three life- and humanity-affirming days in the third week of August: <a href="http://lowlands.nl/" title="Lowlands website">Lowlands</a> is not so much a music festival as a fantastic and sizeable post-human community that meets once a year to enjoy each other’s happy presence.  I had the further privilege of also being in the company of a slightly smaller group of exquisite friends. Hello there exquisite friends! Due to our still-strict policy of <em>What happens at Lowlands, stays at Lowlands</em>, I’m not able to give you much more information than the photo of the main festival entrance above. Please do note the huge “Welcome Home” sign at the centre, it’s quite telling.</p>
<p>Those of you who’ve been with this blog for slightly longer, might remember that <a href="http://cpbotha.net/2009/08/29/starting-today-head-voices-every-week/" title="First edition of the WHV, posted right after LL 2009.">the very first edition of the Weekly Head Voices</a> was posted directly after last year’s Lowlands. <strong>This means that the WHV has now lasted one whole year!</strong> Astute readers will note that the actual frequency of my posts might dictate a name-change to Bi-Weekly Head Voices, which is nice (it has “bi” in there!), but is still not going to happen.</p>
<p>Whatever the case may be: Happy birthday Weekly Head Voices, I wish you very many happy returns!</p>
<p>On the topic of happy returns, and my hobby of somehow managing to string together disparate paragraphs in an almost convincing fashion, <a href="/2010/08/01/the-human-animal-post/" title="Link to my Human Animal post">the animal</a> that houses my consciousness also turned one year older in week 34, three days after Lowlands. I’m not mentioning this so that you can send me presents (although these are always welcome, especially if they’re gadget-related), but rather to dwell briefly on the unexpectedly fabulous day. In spite of the deadline-related stress dominating at that stage, being the happy target of a day-long deluge of such positive facebook messages, texts, email and telephone calls was just beautiful, thank you thank you thank you! I really do love being the gregarious human that I am, right in the middle of this information-age.</p>
<p>Alright boys and girls, it’s now time to get some rest, then to wake up bright and early, and then, then to continue on your life mission of <em>creating value</em>.</p>

<p>So, with that off my chest, I can start with the highlights of this grand week, number 35 of the year 2009.</p>
<p>As many weeks do, this one started with Monday. However, this particular Monday was quite special.  On that very day, we (I have really really terribly fantastic friends, family almost) were having an extremely relaxed yet already nostalgic morning, getting ready to leave the Lowlands 2009 festival grounds, after 3 days of Exceptionally Excellent Times.  Because we have an Exceptionally Strict Rule called “What Happens At Lowlands, Stays At Lowlands”, I can unfortunately not tell you much more than that.  While contemplating The Rule,  you could do worse than watch the YouTube clip below of Whitest  Boy Alive performing 1517, but why would you?:</p>

<p>Apart from my post-festival illness (hey, what do you expect after 3 days of Extremely Little Sleep and Far Too Much Excitement?), the rest of the week consisted of a number of research / technical meetings (these ones are nice, really) with research collaborators, and I took part as external member in the M.Sc. thesis opposition of a student who evaluated the <em>perceived</em> quality of several electron microscopy post-processing filters.  It raised an interesting discussion on perceived quality (of experts) vs. task performance.</p>
<p>Other than that, I’ve rediscovered <a href="http://www.mendeley.com/" title="Mendeley website">Mendeley</a>.  I wasn’t that impressed the previous time, but the current software version 0.9.2.1 has been greatly improved.  The free software runs on Linux, Mac and Windows, and is a kind of beefed up reference manager.  Simply drag and drop an article PDF on it, and all metadata is extracted and inserted into your database.  There’s a <a href="http://www.mendeley.com/import/" title="Mendeley import bookmarklet">bookmarklet</a> that can also slurp information from a large number of citation sites.  You get to synchronise all your references with the Mendeley mothership (website), and you can even synchronise up to 500MB in article PDFs. You can also add other academics as your friends, harr harr.</p>
<p>What I like most about the software, is the ease with which I can now add new references, and also the fantastic built-in PDF reader, which which I can easily annotate PDFs.  What I don’t like, is that it doesn’t yet offer a way for me to use it on multiple machines where I already have synchronised PDF directories.  For now I’m using it to synchronise a subset of my PDF articles (only collections that I’m currently working on) as that still fits in 500MB, but I’d really like to be able to use it across different machines with my own pre-synched directories.  I did add a <a href="http://feedback.mendeley.com/pages/4941-mendeley-feedback/suggestions/301592-pdfs-should-be-attached-with-paths-relative-to-a-user-configurable-base-path" title="Mendeley suggestion w.r.t. pre-synched directories">suggestion</a> concerning this to their feedback thingy.</p>
<p>I’m going to be using it as my main reference manager for a while (I’ve been using JabRef up to now), primarily because it has 90% of what I need in one system.  If you have a Mendeley account, link up with <a href="http://www.mendeley.com/profiles/charl-botha/" title="cpbotha Mendeley profile">my profile</a> man!</p>

<p>That’s it for now boys and girls.  I hope you enjoyed the first weekly head voices, and I hope you have a fabulous week! I’ll see you at its other end harr harr!</p>
