<p>For those of you still wondering, <strong>I’d like to confirm that it is indeed possible to hack a GMail account over insecure WiFi</strong>: GMail does indeed always send your password through secure HTTP (SSL) so that this can’t be directly hacked, BUT, by default, the rest of your session happens through normal clear-text HTTP.  The Watchdog episode of course gives absolutely no technical details, but it’s most probably the <a href="http://www.tgdaily.com/content/view/34324/108/" title="Details on sidejacking attack">“sidejacking” attack</a> first published by <a href="http://erratasec.blogspot.com/" title="Robert Graham's blog">Robert Graham</a>, where the <strong>attacker reads the cookies of the post-authentication HTTP traffic and uses them to fool GMail into thinking that they are in fact the legitimate owners attacked GMail account</strong>.  This attack works on other webmail and -service providers too.</p>
<p>In short, if you EVER use a network connection that you don’t trust, simply change the “http:” in your URL bar to “https:”, or, even better, change your browser connection to “Always use https” on the GMail Settings – General page.   <strong>With both of these solutions, the whole connection will use secure HTTPS (SSL), and cookies can’t be sidejacked</strong>.</p>
<p>The drawback of the secure setting is that your GMail access will be slightly slower than usual:  The encryption costs more compute time at both ends, and the transmission of data is slightly less efficient.</p>
