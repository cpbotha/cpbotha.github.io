<h2 id="the-importance-of-habits">The importance of habits.</h2>
<p>If you have some experience being, you know, alive, and perhaps even trying to
get just that little bit better at it every day, you will have realised by now
that being able to form and maintain good habits is almost a super power.</p>
<p>(Other real-life super powers: Kindness. Peace. Focus. I digress&hellip; haha.)</p>
<p>All of those promises we make to ourselves to read more, to eat better, to
exercise more, to meditate regularly, and so on: The key to making all of these
happen is forming and then maintaining habits.</p>
<p>First the habit has to be created out of nothing, and once it&rsquo;s up and running,
the idea is to keep going at it for as long as possible.</p>
<p><a href="/2019/09/09/weekly-head-voices-177-streakers/#life-optimisation-tip-73-streak-more">Streaking</a>,
that is trying to continue for as long as possible without any interruption, is
a fun and effective trick to keep at it.</p>
<p>However, it is just as important being able to restart a new streak once the
previous one has been broken for whatever reason.</p>
<h2 id="what-the-orgmode-habit-tracker-does">What the Orgmode habit tracker does.</h2>
<p>Up to now, I mostly used <a href="/2019/09/21/note-taking-strategy-2019/#monthly-journal-files">daily checklists to keep track of healthy
habits</a>, but for
some habits, especially ones with a non-daily frequency, this does not work so
well.</p>
<p>A significant step up from daily checklists, the <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Tracking-your-habits.html">Emacs Orgmode habits
function</a> enables you:</p>
<ul>
<li>to specify any number of habits, each with different, sometimes less regular
frequencies;</li>
<li>to track when you perform a habit and when you should next perform it and finally</li>
<li>to visualize if you are performing according to the specifications you have
set.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example: I would like to run at least three times a week. There should be
at least one rest day after a running day (I&rsquo;m not a spring chicken
anymore). There should be a maximum of three rest days allowed (this usually
happens after a longer weekend run).</p>
<p>Although I enjoy running enough to keep this habit up by myself, I chose it as
a first test of the Orgmode habits function.</p>
<p>So far I have setup two other simpler examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>A core exercise which I call &ldquo;The Wheel&rdquo; (of pain). This has to happen every
second day, usually in between running days.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Deep reading&rdquo;, which is meant to describe a session of focused reading of
long-form, i.e. mostly books. This has to happen every day.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before starting tracking of these latter two habits slightly more than a week
ago, I somehow kept on letting them slip.</p>
<p>This morning, my org-agenda looked like this:</p>

</figure>
<p>In the figure you can see that today, represented by the exclamation mark <code>!</code>,
I will have to schedule in a session of deep reading (indicated by the yellow
colouring), and a session of &ldquo;the wheel&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The running habit graph  is showing that I still have three days, including
today, on which I do not have to run.</p>
<p>By default it would not have displayed today, because I ran yesterday, as shown
by the asterisk <code>*</code>, and I specified that minimum of one rest day. However, I
temporarily configured it to show today for the sake of this exposition.</p>
<p>To summarise: These habit graphs show up as part of your org-agenda view and
show you at a glance when you should perform which habits, and, quite
importantly, how long you have been streaking a particular habit.</p>

</pre>
<p>The <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Tracking-your-habits.html">orgmode habits
documentation</a> explains
that a habit is a special sort of <code>TODO</code> node with the following additional
properties, which can all be seen in the above example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The node has a <code>:STYLE:</code> property of <code>habit</code>. Configure with =M-x
org-set-property=.</li>
<li>The node has a <code>SCHEDULED</code> date in the future on the next date when this
habit should take place, along with a frequency / time constraint
specification, in this case <code>.+2d/4d</code>, meaning that at the most every second
day, and at the least every fourth day.</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, with <code>DONE</code> state logging configured as explained above, you&rsquo;ll
get the <code>LOGBOOK</code> with the required state changes used by the habit graphs.</p>
<h3 id="in-use">In use.</h3>
<p>Whenever you&rsquo;ve completed a habit, fire up Emacs (I&rsquo;m joking of course: Emacs
is always running) and then toggle the state of the habit to <code>DONE</code>.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see that it briefly toggles to <code>DONE</code>, and then automatically switches
back to <code>TODO</code>.</p>
<p>(There&rsquo;s some philosophical lesson to be learned from that&hellip;)</p>
<p>When this happens, the <code>:LAST_REPEAT:</code> timestamp will be automatically updated
to the current time, and, more importantly, the <code>SCHEDULED</code> date will be
automatically updated to the next earliest date when this habit should be
exercised.</p>
<p>In the case of the running example above, that will be tomorrow, as today is a
rest day.</p>
<p>Whenever you activate org-agenda, you&rsquo;ll see the habit graphs right at the top,
by default only on the days when they are actually scheduled. In the running
example, that habit will not appear on rest days. (This can naturally be
configured, see <code>M-x describe-variable RET org-habit-show-all-today</code>).</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion.</h2>
<ul>
<li>Being able to forming and maintain habits can form an important component of
better living.</li>
<li><em>Habit streaking</em> is a fun psychological trick to keep you going.</li>
<li>However, don&rsquo;t be disheartened by a broken streak. Get back on that horse and
try again.</li>
<li>Emacs Orgmode habit tracking is a great tool for Emacs users to help form and
maintain habits, especially non-daily ones.</li>

<h2 id="on-friendship-25-years-later">On friendship, 25 years later.</h2>
<p>The birthday <a href="/2019/09/01/weekly-head-voices-176-cycle-of-life/#celebration">mentioned
previously</a>,
along with the portentous visit of a good friend from afar, led to at least two
small celebrations (that I know of) with a bunch of us that have been friends
for more than 25 years now.</p>
<p>In the bigger scheme of things, it&rsquo;s not <em>that</em> long, but what I would like to
mention here is how much such friendships can grow into the most honest of
human connections.</p>
<p>It is as if with the passing years, one is able to shed all of the unnecessary
baggage one tends to carry around as a beginner human.</p>
<p>What is left, is pure human warmth, unconditional support and, perhaps most
significantly, the effortless loss of self.</p>
<p><em>You</em> fade away, quite happily so, when one of your friends gets up in the
light to tell a story.</p>
<p>For a while at least, one&rsquo;s only representative in the conversation is one&rsquo;s
undivided recognition of and attention to the other.</p>
<p>This is certainly not reserved for 25+ year friendships, although this
pre-requisite seems to facilitate the process to the point of effortlessness.</p>

<h3 id="org-pdf-tools-for-constructing-unifying-notes">org-pdf-tools for constructing unifying notes.</h3>
<p>Recently, I had to work through a stack of regulatory documents in PDF format.</p>
<p>The challenge was that the documents described different aspects of a single,
complicated procedure, but were severely lacking in overview-engendering
outlines or, even better, diagrams.</p>
<p>I did what I mostly do when faced with any research-related complexity: BUST
OUT SOME MORE OF THAT EMACS!</p>
<p>I found the Emacs package
<a href="https://github.com/fuxialexander/org-pdftools/">org-pdftools</a>, which I then
<a href="https://github.com/fuxialexander/org-pdftools/pull/4">PRd to work on my newer
Orgmode</a> (github makes
this sort of collaboration so easy!) and then integrated into my workflow.</p>
<p>org-pdftools enables one to link to specific annotated extracts, created
on-demand inside Emacs, from one&rsquo;s orgmode notes.</p>
<p>I used this to synthesise an overview document explaining the whole process,
linking to different parts of multiple PDFs explaining each aspect in more
detail.</p>
<p>Being able to jump effortlessly from a central overview document to specific
positions in reference PDFs is a huge boon to the research process.</p>
<h3 id="escalante">Escalante!</h3>
<p>One friend of work pointed me at an online source of affordable Altras.</p>
<p>I have secretly been pining for a pair of these shoes.</p>
<p>I was planning to use them for the longer runs when I can feel that my feet
need a little more support than my sandals are able to provide.</p>
<p>However, my feet have really gotten used to the wide open spaces of sandals, or
even better, of going barefoot.</p>
<p>Altras are zero-drop shoes, with <em>ginormous</em> toe boxes. Their motto is &ldquo;Embrace
the Space&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It seems like I have found some shoes with the right motto&hellip;</p>

<p>Friend #1&rsquo;s recommendation had shoes that were semi-affordable, contrary to my
expectation.</p>
<p>When I pointed friend #2 from work at friend #1&rsquo;s recommendation, he pointed me
at an even <em>more</em> affordable source.</p>
<p>I <em>could</em> have continued with this iterative process, but I was unable to delay
this purchase any longer.</p>
<p>My new pair of Altra Escalante 1.0s arrived the next day.</p>
<p>(Yes, I know, 1.5 and 2.0 are available. However, <a href="https://runrepeat.com/altra-escalante">the stellar reviews of
1.0</a> have not changed, and did I say
&ldquo;affordable&rdquo;?!)</p>
<p>On Friday I broke them in, and on Sunday I made a slightly longer than normal
run (see in-progress photo above) to see how they did.</p>
<p>Anyways, in spite of the rest of me taking quite a beating on the second run, I
can happily report that the shoes did a marvellous job of balancing support
on the one hand and foot-freedom on the other.</p>
<h2 id="life-optimisation-tip-73-streak-more">Life optimisation tip #73: Streak more.</h2>
<p>As I was scrolling aimlessly through my facebook feed during my last session
before the Great Social Media Fast of September 2019 (see next section), I
quite ironically ran into a truly interesting post by a Swedish visualization
colleague (SVC).</p>
<p>In this post, he talked about his hobby and progress as a <em>run streaker</em>.</p>
<p>It turns out that there are runners with the <em>excellent</em> additional hobby of
<em>streaking</em>, which in <em>this</em> context refers to the act of running every single
day of their lives, and trying to do these daily runs for the longest
continuous streak possible.</p>
<p>The streakers know of each other, almost like Highlander, and are in a friendly
competition, very much unlike Highlander.</p>
<p>SVC now has a single uninterrupted streak, spanning multiple years, of daily
running behind him. He has friends in his city who have also been streaking for
multiple years now.</p>
<p>I find this fantastic, both specifically as a running and fitness feat, and
more generally as a brilliant human optimisation trick.</p>
<p>The longer your streak, the harder it&rsquo;s going to become to break that
streak. Add in the friendly competition element, and you have become an
accomplishment machine.</p>
<p>I see great potential here in the context of
<a href="/2019/06/30/weekly-head-voices-172-abc/#always-be-compounding">compounding</a>
more consistently, and for longer.</p>
<p>What else could we streak folks?</p>
<h2 id="the-great-social-media-fast-of-2019">The Great Social Media Fast of 2019.</h2>
<p>Twitter, Facebook, Reddit and friends&hellip; hot durnit.</p>
<p>Because I recently re-acquired the habit of checking reddit and twitter
multiple times during the day, I again examined the mechanisms driving this
undesirable behaviour.</p>
<p>The insidiousness, at least for me, lies in the fact that TwiFRaF (twitter,
facebook, reddit and friends) always has something looking like new information
on tap, where with tap, I mean firehose.</p>
<p>At any given moment during the day, when brain desires new input, or is just
tired and would like to take a break, TwiFRaF firehoses are ready to spew
something that appears to be new information but is only a very convincing
analogue.</p>
<p>Brain thinks it&rsquo;s getting what it wanted, plus a tiny and uninspired spurt of
discovery-dopamine here and there, which helps to keep up the illusion.</p>
<p>Any chance of real curiousity taking its natural course is cancelled.</p>
<p>Instead of pondering a question, and then going out on a slow and deliberate
search for information and later enlightenment, the firehose is opened, because
it&rsquo;s easier.</p>
<p>Furthermore, brain is unnecessarily exhausted trawling through a mix of mostly
generic rubbish with, granted, an interesting nugget every blue moon.</p>
<p>Hot durnit.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I like experiments, and Cold Turkey is my middle name!</p>
<p>So, on Saturday I decided to cut out TwiFRaF completely.</p>
<p>Initially I thought it would be an experiment until the end of September, but
now I&rsquo;m thinking that streaking might be an even better option.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see.</p>
