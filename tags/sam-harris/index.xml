<p>I am happy that my ever-evolving life philosophy (as well as my approach to
health and wellness) includes a growing section on the importance of hard and
challenging work with great colleagues, because these past few weeks have
really been delivering in that respect.</p>
<p>The rest of this post consists of two main parts: The first is a nerdy bit
about the ease of doing state-of-the-art multi-lingual speech-to-text
transcription on your own computer, and the second is about not being happy.</p>
<h2 id="an-applied-machine-learning-prelude">An applied machine learning prelude</h2>
<p>A few months ago, I listened to a podcast with Sam Harris and Morgan Housel,
titled, quite uncharacteristically for Harris podcasts, &ldquo;Wealth Matters&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Hidden between all of the money- and economics-related information, they
started to talk about human well-being, and specifically about happiness vs
contentment.</p>
<p>As I was driving, a few specific words by Sam Harris dealing with the modest
but robust bliss in everyday contentment really hit home for me.</p>
<p>I made a mental note to find the spot in question later, and then to transcribe
it for this blog.</p>
<p>It went the way of many of my mental notes made while driving and listening to
podcasts&hellip; floating peacefully and oblivious somewhere in my brain.</p>
<p>&hellip; until last week, when the mental note surfaced (!!).</p>
<p>First I graduated the mental note into my Emacs Org mode notes. A few days
later I tracked down the interview in question (man, that Waking Up app has
great content, but it&rsquo;s usability has much room for improvement (low hanging
fruit include 1. automatically continuing current listening and 2. better
search)) and made another note, which on its part led to me sitting down a bit
later with my phone, trying to find the correct spot in the 2 hour podcast.</p>
<p>Fortunately, two attempts got me to the desired segment at 48m55s.</p>
<p>At that point, I could have just manually transcribed the speech in question,
but it turned out to be a longer segment than expected, and then a little voice
(haha) reminded me of <a href="https://openai.com/blog/whisper/">the recent release of OpenAI&rsquo;s multi-lingual
text-to-speech neural network model called Whisper</a>.</p>
<p>In spite of XKCD&rsquo;s extremely valuable <a href="https://xkcd.com/1205/">lessons on when you should or shouldn&rsquo;t
automate a thing</a>, I decided that there was a learning opportunity here and so
I git cloned (nerd for &ldquo;downloaded&rdquo;) the <a href="https://github.com/openai/whisper">Whisper source code</a>.</p>
<p>It took me the most of the time to get the required GPU-capable packages on
Windows, where my RTX 2070 lives (I had to revert to miniforge and conda, see
<code>environment.yml</code> below), and then to record the 6.5 minute audio segment from my
phone using the external microphone on my PC with Audacity (this was the only
way to get the audio out of the app).</p>
<p>Once that was done, Whisper took about a minute (64 seconds to be exact) to
transcribe the 6.5 minutes into absolutely <em>flawless</em>, timestamped English text.</p>
<p>I was quite flabbergasted.</p>
<p>It is now possible to download a pretty compact neural network to your own PC,
and then to use that model to transcribe automatically any number of spoken
languages, optionally also translating in the process.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="happiness-is-a-joke">Happiness is a joke</h2>
<p>The section that really hit home for me is the one in response to this
statement by Morgan Housel, the interview guest:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That difference between happiness and satisfaction is really key and easy to
overlook.  Happiness, like I said earlier, is a very fleeting emotion.</p>
<p>I use the example of, like, if I told you the funniest joke in the world,
you&rsquo;ve never heard a funniest joke, you would laugh for 30 seconds, and then
you&rsquo;d be over it.</p>
<p>And if I told you that joke every day, you&rsquo;d get sick of it, even if it was the
best joke in the world.</p>
<p>Happiness is like that as well, and therefore I think the most that we can aim
for, the best we can aim for, is contentment.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>But when people chase happiness, I think that&rsquo;s when people are setting
themselves up for disappointment, because no matter how funny the joke is, so
to speak, it&rsquo;s a fleeting emotion that sticks around for just very brief
moments before you revert to something else.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a fan of analogies, because they have the tendency to distract folks
from the core of the discussion at hand. In the worst case, people think they
understand the issue because they understand the analogy.</p>
<p>However, here we can say that the world&rsquo;s funniest joke would indeed probably
be as fleeting as that feeling of happiness.</p>
<p>I have heard people joke about Sam Harris, saying he is one of the few humans
who is able to &ldquo;speak in full paragraphs&rdquo;.</p>
<p>His off-the-cuff response, the transcription of which is shown below with my
emphasis, indeed seems to demonstrate that quality.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m a big fan of thinking of well-being in terms of a kind of a <strong>larger
footprint of contentment and equanimity and peace</strong>, you know, non-conflict, as
opposed to the more transitory, hotter experiences of joy and happiness.</p>
<p>I mean, joy is a fleeting emotion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not to say it&rsquo;s not important, and we don&rsquo;t love it.  But there&rsquo;s a kind
of a background context of just not having a problem, which is certainly
underrated.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not something people tend to, when they think of living their best
possible life, people tend to think about joy and fun and even, you know,
ecstasy, and they get bored with words like contentment or peace or equanimity.</p>
<p>And yet, really, when you just look at it, when you study the nature of your
own psychological suffering, really, <strong>the thing that is durable, the thing that
is achievable and, you know, truly enviable</strong>, if you don&rsquo;t have it, <strong>is
contentment</strong>, and it can <strong>deepen to the point where, you know, there&rsquo;s a blissful
component to it</strong>, and it&rsquo;s born of <strong>not craving things that are not here in this
moment</strong>, right?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve <a href="/2017/07/30/weekly-head-voices-124-ceci-nest-pas-dennui/">mentioned at least once before my preference for contentment over
happiness</a>, although I then also cited opinions to the effect that even
contentment was not possible, but I really like the way Sam so eloquently
combines the achievability, the robustness, and <em>especially</em> the bliss that can
be obtained through contentment, which itself can be cultivated through the
active practice of filling the current moment with your full and deliberate
presence.</p>
<h2 id="p-dot-s-dot-about-a-dot-i-dot">P.S. about A.I.</h2>
<p>With the current excitement over all of the applied Large Language Models
(LLMS), especially around the meteoric rise of <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/">ChatGPT</a>, I have resolved to
maintain this blog as a shining example of 100% ad-free and human (namely
me)-generated content.</p>
<p>I have nothing against applying ML, but personally I prefer my blogs as
personal as possible.</p>
<p>It is quite poetic that after making that resolution, I did enlist the help of
an ML model to transcribe the speech in the previous section.</p>
<p>Thinking about this some more, who knows how I might use ML in the future to
help me answer questions, whilst still experiencing that it is truly <em>me</em> who
ends up writing these words.</p>
<p>These distinctions are already quite blurry.</p>
<p>With the technology and its context evolving so rapidly, there&rsquo;s no telling
where this journey will take us.</p>

<p>Where we usually pretend that a WHV covers a certain period of time since the
previous one, this one will simply engage in some excessive but pretty skillful
hand-waving and say that if you read it and the <a href="/2022/01/23/the-2021-to-2022-transition-post/">2021 to 2022 year transition
post</a>, you should be more or less up to date with the state of this nation up to
Sunday, January 30, 2022.</p>
<h2 id="eaz-and-sleep">EAZ and sleep</h2>
<p><a href="/tags/eaz/">EAZ (Experiment Alcohol Zero - no alcohol for at least a month but usually
more)</a> is still going strong, and it&rsquo;s getting harder for me to ignore the fact
that it&rsquo;s (again) having a drastic impact on my sleep quality.</p>
<p>Where I normally am quite chuffed to wake up feeling that I&rsquo;ve had a solid
night of sleep, these days it feels like I&rsquo;m almost guaranteed a great night of
shut-eye as long as I can get to bed on time.</p>
<h2 id="gou-updates">GOU updates</h2>
<p>In other much more important news, <a href="/about/weekly-head-voices-abbreviations/">GOU #1</a> has left the nest.</p>
<p>Ok fortunately only sort of&hellip; She now spends her weeks in the school&rsquo;s
dormitory.</p>
<p>They are extremely well looked-after, and she gets to participate even more
fully in school activities where previously this was a bit constrained by the 1
to 1.5 hour travel time (school bus in traffic) involved.</p>
<p>We do miss her quite a lot in the weeks.</p>
<p>In her absence, GOU #2 (2IC, IOW) has quickly taken on a new role, which is
interesting to see.</p>
<p>GOU #3 has just started with Grade R (first year of &ldquo;big school&rdquo;), and it looks
like she&rsquo;s taken to it like a fish to water.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot more fun now with both #2 and #3 in the car in the mornings,
although we could probably do without all the karma loss I suffer in traffic
every morning. The 4km from my house to school can easily take up to 25
minutes, during which I&rsquo;m obviously surrounded by people who clearly can&rsquo;t
drive.</p>
<h2 id="the-apple-doesn-t-fall-far-from-the-tree">The apple doesn&rsquo;t fall far from the tree</h2>
<p>At the start of 2019 I decided for some or other reason that I really wanted to
know how my branch of the Botha family connected to the rest of the tree.</p>
<p>Botha is a pretty common surname down here.</p>
<p>Many Botha&rsquo;s probably know that we are the descendants of <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Both-15">Friedrich Both</a>, a
soldier who came to the Cape from Wagenheim (from the Thuringen region of
Germany) in 1678 to assist the Dutch colonists.</p>
<p>OR ARE WE?</p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23948326/">A 2013 study by Greeff and Erasmus, titled <em>Appel Botha: The abc of a three
hundred year old divorce case</em></a>, showed that Theunis Botha, the first of four
sons of Friedrich Both and his Dutch wife, Maria Kickers (divorced from Jan
Cornelisz because they could not have children), was in fact the extra-marital
product of Maria&rsquo;s relationship with Ferdinandus Appel!</p>
<p>DUN DUN DUUUUUUUN!</p>
<p>According to the study, Theunis Appel is responsible for roughly half (38000) of all
of the Botha&rsquo;s (78000) living in 2013.</p>
<p>Returning to my branch all the way down here: My uncle E was so kind to send me
notes he made of the gravestones on one of the farms my ancestors lived on,
including full names and dates of birth and death of a number of said
ancestors. As you might realise, full names and birth / death dates are genealogy gold.</p>
<p>My aunt M&rsquo;s many stories helped to fill in any further gaps, especially by
confirming identities through matching full names with nick names.</p>
<p>Although initially I was unable to make the connection to the greater Botha
tree using this information, the <a href="https://www.myheritage.com/">MyHeritage</a> databases, and various bits of
information I could get from older clan members, I recently picked up my notes
again (after a two year hiatus!) and was suddenly able to make a single
high-impact connection (my great-great-grandfather) that I previously missed.</p>
<p>Long story short, the moment I did this all of the fragments came together, and
I&rsquo;m now able to say with reasonable confidence that <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Appel-29">Ferdinandus Appel</a> and <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Kickers-1">Maria
Kickers</a> are my great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandparents.</p>
<p>DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUUN!</p>
<h2 id="i-don-t-want-to-step-over-the-thing">I don&rsquo;t want to step over the thing</h2>
<p>At the end of their <a href="https://lexfridman.com/sam-harris/">3 hour long podcast interview from May</a>, Lex Fridman asks
Sam Harris one of his standard questions (you can listen to the bit in question
<a href="https://youtu.be/4dC_nRYIDZU?t=11241">precisely here</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the meaning of life?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In almost typical Sam Harris fashion, he replies that it&rsquo;s the wrong question.</p>
<p>Less cryptically, Sam explains that if you&rsquo;re searching for that mythical
<em>meaning of life</em> that&rsquo;s going to make everything better, you might be doing it
wrong.</p>
<p>In his words (which I have transcribed and cleaned up a little bit especially
for you):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to live with the illusion anymore that you need a good enough
reason and that things are going to get better when you do get those reasons.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a mirage-like quality to every future attainment and every future
breakthrough and every future peak experience that eventually you get the
lesson that you never quite arrive.</p>
<p><strong>You don&rsquo;t arrive until you cease to step over the present moment in search of
the next thing.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We&rsquo;re constantly stepping over the thing that we think we&rsquo;re seeking in the
act of seeking it.</strong> [ed: my emphasis. I loved this bit]</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t actually become happy. You can only be happy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His words hit home for me.</p>
<p>Dear readers, I truly wish you an abundance of recognizing the thing, and of
<em>being</em> happy.</p>

<p>Since we last connected here, much has transpired, a strangely selected subset
of which is mentioned below:</p>
<h2 id="new-computer">New computer</h2>
<p>An M1 MacBook Air became part of my computing zoo. See <a href="/2021/03/21/new-emacs-capable-hardware-m1-macbook-air/">the new computer post</a> if
you&rsquo;re into that sort of thing. Short version if you&rsquo;re not: It&rsquo;s the best
Emacs-capable device I&rsquo;ve ever used.</p>
<h2 id="pgp-i-m-not-dead-yet">PGP: I&rsquo;m not dead yet!</h2>
<p>In a pleasantly surprising turn of events, I found myself counter-signing PGP
encryption keys with different sets of friends.</p>
<p>In spite of my <a href="/2016/12/11/pgp-never-gonna-give-you-up/">PGP never gonna give you up post</a> of 2016, the thought that
old-fashioned PGP might soon disappear even from my archaic view, to be
replaced by more user-friendly and modern solutions such as <a href="/2016/01/02/when-we-can-lets-use-signal-instead-of-whatsapp/">Signal</a>, has been on
my mind more often recently.</p>
<p>This would not be the worst turn of events. The more people are using secure
and private communication, the better.</p>
<p>However, it <strong>was</strong> fun doing our modest part to bolster the tiny and dwindling
group of humans who know how to use PGP and think that they still should.</p>
<p>All of that being said, we did also make use of the opportunity to perform
defensible <a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007060632-What-is-a-safety-number-and-why-do-I-see-that-it-changed-">Signal safety number verification</a>.</p>
<h2 id="stone-three-healthcare-has-joined-back-up-with-the-rest-of-voltron">Stone Three Healthcare has joined back up with the rest of Voltron</h2>
<p>Back in July of 2019, I <a href="/2019/07/17/weekly-head-voices-173-i-know/#stone-three-healthcare-is-now-a-thing">announced that Stone Three Healthcare had been
officially spun out from Stone Three Venture Technology</a>.</p>
<p>More recently, our corporate mothership embarked on a newly engineered (and
funded) scaling-up journey, bringing with it a host of opportunities for
positive impact on the world.</p>
<p>In the Healthcare company we had to make a choice between sticking it out as a
smaller startup on the one hand, or re-integrating into a newly-designed merged
organization and making use of the extended new capabilities to further our
vision.</p>
<p>(I&rsquo;m really trying to keep it real here, but the line between that and
corp-speak is like mono-filament!)</p>
<p>So, since this past week or so, I&rsquo;m working together with the new merged
entity.</p>
<p>My mandate is now broader in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;ll be focusing on technological solutions for precision Health <strong>and</strong>
Safety, where it was previously healthcare only.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ll be assisting all parts of the company by optimizing technological
processes of all sorts.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is all very exciting to me, and they&rsquo;re even letting me keep some of the
science in my new official title!</p>
<h2 id="the-strange-continuum-of-consciousness">The strange continuum of consciousness</h2>
<p>This is a tricky one to mention, because it probably needs much more space than
I have here, and much more skill than I have to explain.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to try in any case, because just maybe it sparks something for
someone.</p>
<p>A large part of the <a href="https://wakingup.com/">Waking Up meditation</a> daily practice is exploring the exact
nature of one&rsquo;s experienced consciousness.</p>
<p>Specifically, there is the realisation that the whole of your consciousness,
including your thoughts, your interactions with real, live people, and
everything else, takes place in <strong>your</strong> mind.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <em>internal</em> sensations, like an itch, or pain, or a tingling on
your skin, and <em>external</em> sensations, like hearing or sight, although they seem
to be localised <em>inside</em> and <em>outside</em>, take place in the exact same
consciousness.</p>
<p>Everything that you experience, whether &ldquo;real&rdquo;, like looking at the sea, or
imaginary, like thinking about (and hence &ldquo;seeing&rdquo;) something that you need to
take care of tomorrow, or something that you experienced yesterday, are all
simulations that are running as part of your consciousness.</p>
<p>There is a continuum from internal to external, and a continuum from direct
sensory experience to remembered or predicted experience, along with all of its
thoughts and emotions.</p>
<p>These are all the same sort of signals coursing through the same neural
pathways.</p>
<p>Another core idea here is that although your brain is housed in your skull,
your feeling that your consciousness is somehow also localised behind your eyes
is not entirely apt.</p>
<p>Your consciousness is the <em>whole</em> space, with all of your observed reality in
it, <em>including</em> the illusion (or rather simulation) of your localisation.</p>
<p>You (the observer) are not at a single point, but rather everywhere where
consciousness is.</p>
<p>Everything that you perceive to happen, by definition &ldquo;happens&rdquo; in the space
that you call consciousness.</p>
<p>These are tricky lessons to learn, and it seems that at least in my case we are
destined to spend only fleeting moments together, but they have profound and
positive implications for how we go through life.</p>

<h2 id="random-notes-on-the-kogelberg-trail-adventure">Random notes on the Kogelberg Trail adventure</h2>
<ul>
<li>Taking the day off to go run in the mountains: These two separately pleasant
actions are even greater when applied together.</li>
<li>Based on the predictions a week or so before the time, we were going to run
in a bit of rain. As the date came closer, the predicted start time of the
rain kept on creeping later and later. The day itself was mostly gorgeous
sunshine with very little wind.</li>
<li>According to the Cape Nature peeps at the starting point, we were the first
people to run the route since before the lockdown when they, err, locked down
the nature reserve. This was noticeable by the overgrown vegetation we had to
fight through for a kilometre or two, just after the first climb. Other than
that, it felt pretty special!</li>
<li>I like running with a GPX of the route on my Apple Watch (<a href="http://www.workoutdoors.net/">WorkOutDoors</a> is
amazing for following a route with maps while you&rsquo;re running, especially if
you&rsquo;re directionless like me), but I could not find one available online
before the time.
<ul>
<li>So I started a Strava Pro trial so I could use their amazing <a href="https://www.strava.com/heatmap">global heatmap</a>
to draw the crowd-sourced GPX in about 6 clicks. I&rsquo;m probably going to keep
the Strava Pro: Being able to make routes like this of any place that you
might find yourself in is amazing.</li>
<li>You can download a GPX of the route we actually ran, as logged by my
iPhone, by clicking on the following link: <a href="./kogelberg_trail_cpbotha_20201008.zip">Kogelberg Trail GPX</a>. The whole
thing is just under 24km.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="find-a-place-in-the-universe-that-is-your-consciousness">Find a place in the universe that is your consciousness</h2>
<p>On the morning of October 7, about halfway through a 10 minute mindfulness
practice with <a href="https://wakingup.com/">the Waking Up app</a>, Sam Harris says something like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Take a negative emotion, and examine it. Remember, you can find a place in
consciousness that is not implicated, to stand on and be able to do this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His words really struck home at that moment.</p>
<p>By the end of the session, analysing a particular negative thought, I
experienced quite viscerally (haha, sorry) the phenomenon of relatively easily
finding a non-implicated mental space to stand, from where I could take apart
that negative emotion piece by piece, without being drawn into it at all.</p>
<p>Now it feels like all of those practice sessions exploring the <em>experience</em> of
consciousness, as the whole of the reality simulation being run over the
trillions of neural connections in the human brain, were not in vain.</p>
