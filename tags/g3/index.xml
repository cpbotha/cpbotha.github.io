<p>I dug up an email I wrote to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Stepanov">Alex Stepanov</a> and Meng Lee, authors of the C++ Standard Template Library on Monday August 3, 1998, to ask them if they would have written a matrix template, if they would have derived it from the vector template. Stepanov answered, the next day (!), <em>that he had never found much use for inheritance</em>. In those days, nerd celebrities mailed you back. Also, poor old C++ inheritance…</p>
<p>A few years later, but still back in the day, <a href="https://twitter.com/gerwindehaan">@gerwindehaan</a> and I wrote a time management web-app which could automatically schedule all of your tasks. In other words, it would decide exactly <em>what</em> you needed to do <em>when</em> in order to hit all of your deadlines, your appointments and your priorities. It had an ugly UI (story of my life), but it worked (story of my life?). That whole adventure marked the start of our downward spiral away from academia and into the sea of money and debauchery we currently find ourselves in. In any case, I resurrected the old TimeScapers website and wrote a <a href="http://timescapers.com/2016/02/07/timescapers-and-timerank-retrospective/">short little retrospective blog post</a> if you’re interested.</p>
<p>I got tired of waiting for the OTA (over the air) update to Marshmallow (that’s Android 6.0) for my LG G3, so I booted into Windows 10 (yes, I have a partition with that also), and used <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/g4/help/lgup-install-kdz-mm-lp-t3249803">LGUP</a> with the <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/lg-g3/help/downgrade-mm-to-lp-using-lg-t3283912/post64597779#post64597779">8974 DLL</a>  (very important to use this and NOT the 8994, else you WILL FAIL) and the official <a href="http://csmgdl.lgmobile.com/dn/downloader.dev?fileKey=FW4DYI8332GOAME9EB45Q8B/D85530B_00_1217.kdz">LG G3 Marshmallow KDZ</a> (1.3GB md5sum 711d91254f5e3e02536395b35e1d534f) to upgrade the phone. After one day I can say the following: Looks mildly prettier and feels slightly smoother, but battery life has improved phenomenally. Let me know in the comments if you need help with doing this on your own phone.</p>
<p>The graphical warning below is why I’m not ready to shave my beard quite yet (click for imgur source):</p>

<p>As you might or might not have heard, our currency has recently taken quite a serious knock. Fortunately, it’s still extremely good for exchanging for meaty pleasures, such as the almost 2.5kg of rib-eye and t-bone you see in the photo below. Prepared and enjoyed with good friends, this was as beautiful as it looks. The hand you see in the picture belongs to my friend, who is a giant.</p>

<p>Don’t worry, I don’t eat that much meat every day. Also, when I grow up, I want to be a vegan:</p>

<p>(It’s almost just like when someone is doing their MBA! Have I offended enough people yet? I was also planning to insult people who manage to take <a href="http://www.cracked.com/funny-304-ayn-rand/">Ayn Rand</a> seriously, but <a href="http://www.alternet.org/story/150680/the_truth_about_gop_hero_ayn_rand">they’re not very good</a> with multi-syllabic words, or reading in general. Furthermore, my beef with vegans (I’m on the roll here) and with MBA students is actually just good-natured teasing, a tone I would prefer to maintain. For now.)</p>
<p>Have a great week kids, I hope to see you on the other side!</p>
