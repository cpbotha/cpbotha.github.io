<p>As far as I can see now, the week from Monday April 8 to Sunday April 14 2019,
although otherwise quite solid in terms of productivity and of The Important

<p>About the exact implications of this discrepancy, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_a_tree_falls_in_a_forest">I am also not entirely

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Last week, <a href="/2019/04/08/weekly-head-voices-168-postcards-from-the-edge/#nim-surprise">I had happily started diving into the nim language and its
ecosystem</a>.</p>
<p>I was quite happy to hear that in addition to the enjoyment it had given me,
the spark had jumped over to at least one other peep (O HAI THERE S!) via
these writings.</p>
<p>However, after getting deeper into <a href="https://github.com/dom96/jester/issues/194">jester&rsquo;s multi-threading
intricacies</a> and discovering that
I could not get run-time confirmation that my requests were being handled by
separate threads, I returned to my initial target language for this experiment of
rewriting, namely f#!</p>
<p>nim is really a great little experiment: It consists of higher level
abstractions that compile down to C, and it&rsquo;s quite amazing to see what this
enables one to do.</p>
<p>However, I require something richer and more functional for my language
learning slot.</p>
<p>As I have written previously, <a href="/2018/07/17/weekly-head-voices-148-data-stylist/#f">f# hits all six of my 2018
PL-requirements</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to the qualities of the language itself, <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-preview-3/">dotnet core 3, currently
at preview
3</a>, is
showing great progress, also in terms of memory efficiency and raw
performance.</p>
<p>I spent some time during the past week to re-re-implement my
nim-re-implementation of parts of isso, again purely for learning purposes.</p>
<p>(As an aside, it&rsquo;s interesting how close such a real-world example enables one
to get to using a tool or language <em>in anger</em>.)</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a fragment from my learning experiment, because if you&rsquo;re like me
you&rsquo;ll want to see what f# looks like:</p>

handles a request with a <code>uri</code> query parameter. First it looks up the comment
thread in the isso database. If it finds a thread, it looks up the comments
and returns the whole list as JSON.</p>
<p>As you can see, there is error handling at every level.</p>
<p>F# code is expressive, but it is also fully typed. In this case it is
executed asynchronously (that&rsquo;s what the <code>task {}</code> and the <code>!</code>s are for), with
the asynchronous tasks distributed over threads.</p>
<p>In other words, we have a compiled functional language with Python-level
expressivity with really strong (and easy!) concurrency support.</p>

<h2 id="someone-is-right-on-the-internet">Someone is right on the internet.</h2>
<p><em>My</em> week might not have been the most blog-worthy, but, my goodness, the
Wonderful World of Science has not been sitting still!</p>
<p>You see, in desperation I went rummaging through the recent additions to
<a href="/2019/03/21/weekly-head-voices-165-get-in-my-pocket/#replacing-pocket-with-just-a-bunch-of-pdfs-jbop">JBOP</a>,
aka my growing collection of Really Interesting PDFs, and I hand-picked a few
tidbits worthy of casually mentioning during the undoubtedly erudite
discussion at your next cocktail party!</p>
<h3 id="each-millilitre-of-vosub2sub-max-reduces-your-risk-of-dying-by-28">Each millilitre of VO<sub>2</sub> max reduces your risk of dying by 2.8%.</h3>
<p>If we&rsquo;ve run (I see what I did there) into each other more than once, <a href="/2018/10/23/weekly-head-voices-156-karma-chameleon/#grab-bag-of-thought-and-or-debate-provoking-pieces">I&rsquo;ve
probably
mentioned</a>
last year&rsquo;s publication of the Cleveland treadmill study where they put 122000
people on a treadmill (the study took 20 years) to show that being unfit on a
treadmill is at least as risky (in terms of you dying) as being a smoker.</p>
<p>Well, last week the result of an even larger Swedish study, with 316137
participants, <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-04/esoc-mmt040819.php">were reported at EuroPrevent
2019</a>.</p>
<p>With each additional millilitre of oxygen per kilogram of body mass per minute
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VO2_max">VO<sub>2</sub> max, a cardiorespiratory fitness
measure</a>), the risk of all-cause
mortality fell by 2.8%, and the risk of cardiovascular events fell by 3.2%.</p>
<p>According to at least <a href="https://www.topendsports.com/testing/norms/vo2max.htm">one
source</a>, the range
between poor and excellent VO<sub>2</sub> max in most age segments for men and
women is 20 millilitres or more.</p>
<p>At 2.8% per millilitre, that certainly makes one think!</p>
<h3 id="hpv-vaccine-linked-to-dramatic-drop-in-cervical-disease">HPV vaccine linked to dramatic drop in cervical disease.</h3>
<p>Almost exactly 10 years ago, I wrote <a href="/2009/05/21/you-must-vaccinate/">a post on this blog titled &ldquo;You must
vaccinate&rdquo;</a> because friends and acquaintances
were asking questions which I found surprising on the one hand and quite
alarming on the other.</p>
<p>At that point I thought that even the slowest among us would have caught up to
the fact that there are an extremely large number of good reasons to
vaccinate, and almost none not to.</p>
<p>It seems that I over-estimated the capabilities and size of the slow group&hellip;</p>
<p>It is now 10 years later, and the anti-vaxxers have managed to <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/29-11-2018-measles-cases-spike-globally-due-to-gaps-in-vaccination-coverage">bring measles
(and some friends) back from
extinction</a>.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there is also much to celebrate on the vaccination front.</p>
<p>Scotland started with their <a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/human-papillomavirus">human
papillomavirus</a>
vaccination programme 10 years ago, administering the vaccine to girls when
they are at around 12 years of age.</p>
<p>Researchers now say that since then the HPV vaccine has <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-47803975">&ldquo;nearly wiped out
cases of cervical pre-cancer in young
women&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s also heartening is that unvaccinated women also showed a reduction in
disease, implying that the immunisation programme is protecting even more
humans from the disease due to the herd effect.</p>
<p>(GOU#1 had her HPV shot at school last year. There were parents who
complained. I don&rsquo;t know if there were any refusers.)</p>
<p>I am still hopeful that one day all of these victories will contribute to the
attrition of the irresponsibly dangerous anti-vaxx movement.</p>
<h3 id="how-the-matrix-built-a-bullet-proof-legacy">How The Matrix Built A Bullet-Proof Legacy.</h3>
<p>Surprise! This one is not from science, but it was such an amazing read that I
have to share.</p>
<p>If, like me, you saw The Matrix more times than you can count, you will also
enjoy this write-up of how the whole project came together:</p>
<p>Extract from the book <em>How 1999 blew up the Big Screen</em> by Brian Raftery: <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-matrix-legacy-book-excerpt/">HOW
THE MATRIX BUILT A BULLET-PROOF
LEGACY</a></p>
<h2 id="you-never-write">You never write.</h2>
<p>At Tuesday&rsquo;s edition of the Helderberg Software Developers and Entrepreneurs
meetup, organised by <a href="https://wogan.blog/">Wogan May</a> (pssst, he has a
personal blog with mostly weekly updates!) and myself, <a href="http://johan.beyers.co.za/">Johan
Beyers</a> talked about the personal resolution of
doing a given amount of (personal) writing every day.</p>
<p>I try to do it once weekly with the WHV, and I mostly manage to make a few
bullet points detailing my exploits every day, but the idea of additionally
writing a few more prose-like paragraphs of thoughts every day really
resonates with me.</p>
<p>Derek Sivers (he was a famous startup-person even before the whole startup
boom, thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/gerwindehaan">Gerwin de Haan</a> for that book
so many years ago!) <a href="https://sivers.org/dj">makes a good case for writing a few diary-like sentences
every evening</a>.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s even more intriguing, is his suggestion to maintain separate &ldquo;Thoughts
On&rdquo; journals for various topics that you think about often. In my case, these
could be for example &ldquo;Thoughts on Programming Languages&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Thoughts on
mindfulness for children&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Thoughts on the WHV rules for a contented
life&rdquo;, and so on.</p>
<p>I think it would be a cunning plan to give both of these additional writing
practices a good go.</p>
<p>Let me know in the comments what you think!</p>

<p>I was mistakenly under the impression that, at least in my social circles, the
whole vaccination issue had been put completely to rest, but based on the
number of serious questions that I’ve been asked recently, this
unfortunately does not seem to be the case.</p>
<p>For those of you who don’t have time, I’ll cut to the chase immediately:</p>
<p><strong>Yes, you simply <em>must</em> vaccinate your children.  This is the <em>best and
safest</em> choice, for both your child and your fellow humans.</strong></p>
<p><strong>No, there is no link between vaccination and autism. No, spreading out the
(MMR) vaccinations is not safer, it is in fact more dangerous.  Also, the
“vaccine overload” hypothesis is flawed.</strong></p>
<p>For those of you with a bit more time or those of you who are not willing to take me on my word, I’ll go into some more detail on each of the points mentioned above.  Most of what I write here is based on articles in the Wikipedia.  I’ve deliberately done this, because these articles are accessible and readable to everyone, and they do link to the original scientific articles that they are based on.  Feel free to jump to any section.  Also, each section ends with a short summary of its contents to make it easier for you to skip.</p>
<h1 id="recent-history">Recent history</h1>
<p><em>This section is based on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMR_vaccine_controversy" title="Wikipedia article on MMR vaccine controversy">Wikipedia article on the MMR vaccine
controversy</a>.</em></p>
<p>In 1998, Andre Wakefield and co-authors published a paper in the Lancet where,
based on 12 case reports, they speculated on a possible link between the MMR
vaccination and autism, and also speculated that it might be better to space
out the vaccinations.  Of course the press and media picked this up and went
completely wild, causing a health scare in the UK.  It is important to note
that both of these claims were highly speculative.</p>
<p>It later turned out that Wakefield had received 55000 (fifty-five thousand) UK
pounds from Legal Aid Board solicitors who were gathering evidence to use in a
case against vaccine manufacturers, and that a number of parents of the
children taking part in Wakefield’s study were directly involved in the
law-suit.  Wakefield did not mention any of this at the time of publication. 
Ten of his 12 co-authors have since completely retracted their interpretation
of the paper.</p>
<p>In short, the author of the paper that started most of the modern vaccination-autism scare was completely corrupt, and his corruption directly affected this specific research.</p>
<p>He did manage to cause such a scare in the UK, that measles (one of the diseases that MMR vaccinates against) is for the first time in decades at almost epidemic levels.   Since then, there have been cases of measles killing children, something which would most probably not have happened had the vaccination compliance not been at an all-time low.  Isn’t that absolutely crazy when one considers that measles was all but eradicated?</p>
<p>In the years between 1998 and the present, there have been numerous extremely well-designed and large studies, none of which have been able to find <em>any</em> kind of link between vaccination and autism.</p>
<p><em>To summarise this section: The research that the vaccination scare is based
on, was deeply flawed and based on corruption, not science.</em></p>
<h1 id="spreading-out-of-vaccines">Spreading out of vaccines</h1>
<p><em>This section is based on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_controversy#Vaccine_overload" title="Wikipedia article on Vaccine controversy.">Wikipedia article on the general Vaccine
Controversy</a>.</em></p>
<p>In some cases, parents opt for spreading out the vaccinations, because they
mistakenly think that this is safer than not doing so.  The flawed idea that
administering all these vaccines together could be dangerous is called the
“vaccine overload hypothesis”.  It is flawed for the reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Common childhood ilnesses represent a much heavier load on the infant immune system.</li>
<li>The vaccination cocktail given currently represents less than 10% of the immunological load of the vaccinations given to children in the 80s.</li>
<li>Numerous studies have shown that the combination of vaccinations does NOT damage the infant immune system.</li>
</ul>
<p>Importantly, if you spread out vaccines, you increase the time during which your child is susceptible to the diseases that are being vaccinated again, thus greatly increasing the health risk to your child and all other children it comes into contact with.  You are a bad parent if you do this.</p>
<p><em>To summarise this section:</em> <em>Administering the vaccinations together does not damage your child’s immune system.</em> <em>Spreading out vaccines is dangerous for both your child and all children it comes into contact with.</em></p>
<h1 id="celebrities-campaigning-against-vaccination">Celebrities campaigning against vaccination</h1>
<p>Recently, a number of celebrities, most prominent of which Jenny McCarthy and
her partner Jim Carrey, supported by Oprah, have been campaigning against
vaccination.  You have to remember that these are actors and entertainers,
with almost ZERO medical or scientific background or training.   McCarthy
dropped out of nursing school to become a Playboy Bunny: There’s nothing
wrong with that, but you really cannot base important medical decisions,
concerning the health and survival of your child (!!), on the opinions of an
erstwhile nude model!</p>
<p>_To summarise: Think carefully about the scientific and medical backgrounds of
actors telling you how to care for the health and well-being of your child,
even more so when it concerns life and death issues such as vaccination.</p>
<h1 id="the-logical-conclusion">The logical conclusion</h1>
<p>To the best of our scientific knowledge, vaccinations as they are administered today are safe and do not cause autism.  In spite of this, research continues day and night to make sure of this observation.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you don’t vaccinate, the risk of your child
getting ill and dying is <em>significantly</em> higher.  If a large enough number of
you don’t vaccinate, we lose our herd immunity and then there is a very
real risk that <em>many</em> more of our children will get ill and die due to your
inaction.  Do you seriously want to take this very real risk with your <em>and</em>
my children’s lives?</p>

<p>I hope that this has helped.  If there are any issues that are not clear, or
missing, or you are not convinced, please let me know so that we can discuss
