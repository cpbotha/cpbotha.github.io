It&amp;rsquo;s Monday evening around 22:31.
The track “Still on Fire” by Trentemøller is making my neurons fire in highly pleasant patterns while I try to gaze back through time at the days from Monday October 22 to Sunday November 4, and to gather my thoughts.
I have come to a decision:
The rest of this blog will be less melodramatic.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>It&rsquo;s Monday evening around 22:31.</p>
<p>The track <a data-rel="lightbox-video-0" href="https://youtu.be/liHjofQBAeM">“Still on Fire” by Trentemøller</a> is making my neurons fire in highly pleasant patterns while I try to gaze back through time at the days from Monday October 22 to Sunday November 4, and to gather my thoughts.</p>
<p>I have come to a decision:</p>
<p>The rest of this blog will be less melodramatic. Instead, I shall focus my efforts on puns.</p>
<p>(You should still listen to the track.)</p>
<h2 id="productivity-and-focus">Productivity and Focus</h2>
<h3 id="vitamin-r--tomatoes-for-apples">Vitamin-R – tomatoes for apples!</h3>
<p>As a <a href="https://cpbotha.net/?s=mytomatoes">quick search will tell you</a>, we here at the WHV headquarters are big fans of <a href="http://mytomatoes.com/">mytomatoes.com</a>, an online pomodoro timer that keeps track of your pomodori in a truly low friction fashion.</p>
<p>Bonus factoid: mytomatoes was built and is maintained by <a href="https://twitter.com/magnars?lang=en">Magnar Sveen</a>, who is revered, at least in my circles, as a young Emacs god. Take a gander at his <a href="http://emacsrocks.com/">jaw-dropping dexterity and raw nerd power</a>. The <a data-rel="lightbox-video-1" href="https://youtu.be/jNa3axo40qM">one where he uses Emacs to calculate the number of hours his videos have wasted</a> around the world is especially good.</p>
<p>I digress.</p>
<p>Some of us need a constant reminder that we&rsquo;re trapped inside a tomato with absolutely no way to get out.</p>
<p>mytomatoes lives in a browser window, and can easily disappear under the thousands of distractions trying to snatch victory from your ambitious little hands.</p>
<p>No friends. Nothing less than a permanent reminder on the main OSX menubar will do!</p>
<p>I initially made a small misstep with Be Focused Pro. This does satisfy the requirement of displaying a timer in the menubar, but also tries, unfortunately quite badly, to be a task manager, and to connect each pomodoro to a task that you have to create. (As an <a href="https://orgmode.org/">orgmode</a> user, I have infinitely high expectations of any task manager.)</p>
<p>I digress. Again.</p>
<p>After 30 minutes of searching, I fortunately landed on <a href="http://www.publicspace.net/Vitamin-R/">Vitamin-R</a> (the new version 3) on October 29. Since then, it has helped me to churn successfully through an impressive number of pomodori.</p>
<p>Why I&rsquo;m probably going to buy this after the evaluation period:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vitamin-R is exactly configurable enough. I could get it to work exactly like I wanted, without having to wade through an overly complex UI.</li>
<li>I get to log what work I plan to do during each pomodoro, and I get to edit this afterwards, but it&rsquo;s incredibly low friction, i.e. no task creation and so on.</li>
<li>It has a number of simple but useful charts that help me to do better each day.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="multiple-desktops-seem-to-have-been-detrimental-to-my-focus">Multiple-desktops seem to have been detrimental to my focus.</h3>
<p>Back in the early 90s, I started using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_desktop">multiple virtual desktops</a> on my humble Linux 0.99pl13 computer. Because the year of the Linux Desktop was never really to be, we had to console (nerd pun, sorry) ourselves with obscure features like this.</p>
<p>Fast forward a few years, and Ctrl-Alt-SOMENUMBER is deeply ingrained into my muscle memory. 1 is work, 2 is more work, 3 is Emacs (all hail her greatness) and related admin tools, 4 is email and other communication, 5 is browsing and 6 is utility browsing.</p>
<p>This means that a single neuron misfiring leads to my number 5 finger (index) lashing upwards, like some sort of digital (Latin pun intended, work with me here people) cobra, with thumb and pinkie deftly dance-dance-revolutioning over to respectively alt and control, which switches me away from my work (usually 1 or 3) to browsing, all of this in about 3 milliseconds.</p>
<p>This visual shock routinely causes <a href="/2018/05/20/weekly-head-voices-143-the-rider-and-the-elephant/">the rider on my mental elephant</a> to keel over backwards and fall from the large pachyderm.</p>
<p>Hours of web-browsing ensue, during which my already extensive knowledge of useless trivia is expanded, but no to absolutely no work is done.</p>
<p>This stage is usually followed by the guilt, and the crying to sleep, and the renewed chasing of deadlines the next day.</p>
<p>In my feeble but eternal endeavour to increase my focus, I recently tried to mitigate the effects of these misfiring neurons by disabling multiple desktops.</p>
<p>Yes readers, like many of you have wisely been doing all along, I am now limited to a single desktop.</p>
<p>Desktop One: I can&rsquo;t switch there, because I am already here, right now.</p>
<p>Before I started this experiment, I searched for any relevant scientific literature, but came up quite empty. It could be because it&rsquo;s a complicated thing to measure. People are very different, and the computing they do is very different.</p>
<p>Whatever the case may be, my experience the past two weeks has been positive.</p>
<p>In spite of neurons misfiring and muscle memory invoking key combinations, I have been staring quite dutifully at Desktop One all this time.</p>
<h2 id="two-other-blog-posts-that-you-might-find-interesting-i-dont-know-let-me-know-in-the-comments-or-dont">Two other blog posts that you might find interesting I don&rsquo;t know let me know in the comments or don&rsquo;t.</h2>
<p>Between this and the previous WHV, I wrote two other blog posts that I know of:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://vxlabs.com/2018/10/29/importing-orgmode-notes-into-apple-notes/">Importing all of your orgmode notes into Apple Notes for mobile access</a> – This used to be a huge weakness of my otherwise amazing orgmode-based note-taking: I could not access any of my Orgmode notes from my phone. In the end, all I needed to do was to use Orgmode&rsquo;s built-in HTML site publishing function to get hundreds of org files, including images, math, source code and other wisdom, into my Apple Notes, ready to search and access on the phone.</li>
<li><a href="https://vxlabs.com/2018/11/04/pytorch-1-0-preview-nov-4-2018-packages-with-full-cuda-10-support-for-your-ubuntu-18-04-x86_64-systems/">PyTorch 1.0 preview (Nov 4, 2018) packages with full CUDA 10 support for your Ubuntu 18.04 x86_64 systems</a> – The title says it all. The backstory (not in that post) is that I now have a private RTX 2070 With TensorCores(tm) !!!1!! at my disposal, with which I plan to do my part in bringing about the AI-pocalypse. (Actually, I just want the AIs to take away all of our driving licenses. Humans are truly crappy drivers.)</li>

<h2 id="gou2-discovers-parts-of-buddhism-in-the-car-on-the-way-to-school">GOU#2 discovers parts of Buddhism in the car on the way to school.</h2>
<p>On Monday, October 23, as we were on our way to school, GOU#2, age 8, explained something she had come to realise.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about really wanting that certain brilliant and <em>clearly</em> amazing toy.</p>
<p>You want it so much, but you have to wait so long for it.</p>
<p>When you finally do get it, you play with it for a while, but you soon realise that it&rsquo;s really not making you as happy as you thought it would.</p>
<p>I listened carefully to her story.</p>
<p>As far as I could establish, it did sound like a general lesson she had extracted, that is, not just about that one specific dud toy.</p>
<p>I explained to her and GOU#1 that that was a core learning from Buddhism.</p>
<p>We humans desire things, and we go to great lengths to acquire them, and once we have them, we usually realise that the happiness they bring is fleeting at best.</p>
<p>If we are clever, we see this pattern, and so we stop desiring things, instead finding happiness wherever we are right now.</p>
<p>Me?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on <em>Desktop One</em>.</p>
