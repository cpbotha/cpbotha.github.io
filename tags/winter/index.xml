<h2 id="winter-don-t-call-us-we-ll-call-you">Winter, don&rsquo;t call us, we&rsquo;ll call you</h2>
<p>Shortly after the start of this period, June 21 to be exact, I was frankly and
quite pleasantly surprised by the Southern Hemisphere winter solstice.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/sun/south-AFRICA/cape-town">This handy Time and Date website</a> has more details, including but not limited
to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The June solstice (winter solstice) in Cape Town is at 11:13 on Tuesday, 21
June 2022. In terms of daylight, this day is 4 hours, 32 minutes shorter than
the December solstice. In locations south of the equator, the shortest day of
the year is around this date.</p>
<p>The earliest sunset is on 12 June. The latest sunrise is on 29 June or 30 June.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of you <a href="/2021/06/16/weekly-head-voices-226-stress-practice/#solstice-tipping-point-is-coming">might remember</a> that this is an important point in the year for me,
the moment when I can see the big light, namely summer, at the end of the
tunnel.</p>
<h2 id="projections">Projections</h2>
<p>I recently finished reading the book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/55411738-projections"><em>Projections: A Story of Human Emotions</em>
by Karl Deisseroth</a>.</p>
<p>As a layperson, I found this psychiatrist and world-changing scientist&rsquo;s view
of the world, and especially of the psyches of his patients, absolutely
fascinating.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Deisseroth">Deisseroth</a> writes about several different types of psychiatric disorders, but
does so via specific but (probably) fictional patients who embody the important
aspects of the disorder in question.</p>
<p>He also writes about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optogenetics">Optogenetics</a>.</p>
<p>Optogenetics is a technique, invented by Deisseroth, for controlling neurons
with lasers, <em>in vivo</em>.</p>
<p>More specifically, by inserting specific genes from algae, neurons can be
modified to activate when struck by light.</p>
<p>Using this technique, researchers are able to activate very specific subsets of
neurons in mice brains, making the mice feel anxious for example, or
comfortable, or any of the different neural components making up these mental
states.</p>
<p>From the Wikpedia artictle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In systems neuroscience, the ability to control the activity of a genetically
defined set of neurons has been used to understand their contribution to
decision making, learning, fear memory, mating, addiction, feeding, and
locomotion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The use of this technique has already contributed significantly to our
fundamental understanding of the brain, and the first steps have been taken
towards using it in therapy.</p>
<p>Judging by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optogenetics#Awards">the list of awards</a>, the scientific world has really noticed the
value of this work.</p>
<p>Personally, I am optimistic that there&rsquo;s much more to come.</p>
<p>P.S. Close to the end of <a href="https://lexfridman.com/karl-deisseroth/">the Lex Fridman podcast with Deisseroth</a>, Deisseroth
mentioned that he really doubts whether he has done enough&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="batting-for-biyamiti">Batting for Biyamiti</h2>
<p>I am Bat-Fan.</p>
<p>No really, I appreciate bats. (and puns)</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re little flying mammals who see and navigate the world <em>expertly</em> using
echolocation (just imagine what that <em>feels</em> like?!) . They eat large numbers of
insects, including a <a href="https://news.wisc.edu/study-bolsters-bats-reputation-as-mosquito-devourers/">debatable</a> number of mosquitoes (I did not know about the
debate until right now).</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s not to like?</p>
<p>However, during our recent freshly reinstated yearly <a href="/2019/06/30/weekly-head-voices-172-abc/">KNP break</a>, we enjoyed
fantastic summer weather (it&rsquo;s winter down here, but that&rsquo;s Mpumalanga for
you), we spent one night in Biyamiti with a pretty active bat in the room.</p>
<p>As we went to sleep, we thought that it would probably be ok.</p>
<p>It was not.</p>
<p>In addition to the bat expertly dropping something wet in my eye (your guess is
as good as mine), during parts of the night it started doing fly-bys so close
to our faces that we could feel the discrete wind gusts caused by the flapping
of its little wings.</p>
<p>On the one hand I was quite impressed by its sheer <em>mammalian</em> skill, but on
the other we just really wanted to sleep.</p>
<p>We decided that the price of a few extra insects in the room was worth it, and
so we opened the mesh.</p>
<p>Our bat friend, in spite of apparently having built a little nest in the nook
right up in the apex of the roof, fortunately obliged by exiting to perform the
rest of its manouevres outside in the night.</p>

<p>Although it&rsquo;s grey and cold and rainy down here at the moment, I console myself
with the fact that the days are slowly but surely getting longer again, minute
by minute.</p>
<p>Starting from the depths of the Winter Solstice on June 21, when there were 9
hours and 53 minutes of daylight, today that had already stretched to a period
of 10 hours and 16 minutes.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re slowly making our way to 14 hours and 25 minutes of daylight on December
22, the Summer Solstice.</p>
<p>Although I do try to savour every moment, I can&rsquo;t help but look forward to the
warmth.</p>
<p>Anyways, the rest of this post exploded into a solid dollop of backyard
philosophy, which I hope you enjoy.</p>
<h2 id="bullet-list-of-miscellany-blom">Bullet List of Miscellany (BLoM).</h2>
<p>Before we dig in to the promised solid dollop, let&rsquo;s warm up with a BLoM.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/2019/07/17/weekly-head-voices-173-i-know/#bullet-list-of-miscellany-blom">Last week I
reported</a>
that we had half-bricked the solar inverter with a firmware upgrade. Shortly
after that, with some help from local support, we reflashed everything from
scratch (note: Although the manual says NOT to use EzFlash for GW5048-ES
inverters shipped after March, you in fact have to use EzFlash in this case)
and, lo and behold, the inverter was resurrected!
<ul>
<li>With BMS (battery management system) communication online, the system works
like a charm. Record solar consumption so far is 24.1 kWh, which is great for
winter!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>My favourite (and only) TPN (Tall Philosophical Neighbour) alerted me to the
fact that images were positively ginormous in the email version of this
blog. I&rsquo;ve fine-tuned the Hugo image-resizing shortcode to do a better job.</li>
<li>After a discussion with a friend from work about kindness, I came across this
post I wrote five (5) years ago: <a href="/2014/09/09/weekly-head-voices-81-middle-aged-zen/">Weekly Head Voices #81 - Middle-aged
zen</a>. For me it was worth
reading again. (Also, the person who wrote that seems to be more advanced
than I currently am. Life is circles.)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="life-is-but-a-dream">Life is but a dream.</h2>
<p>I would like to take you on a little trip.</p>
<p>Please imagine an extremely dark room.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re stuck in this room.</p>
<p>Fortunately there are two really small holes in the thick black walls through
which light shines in. If you get up and peak out through the holes, you can
make out what&rsquo;s going on outside of the room.</p>
<p>There are two more holes through which you can hear sounds from the outside
world, if you put your ears up to them.</p>
<p>Every day, someone shoves food in through yet another small hole.</p>
<p>At least you won&rsquo;t go hungry.</p>
<p>However, if you have to be honest, this room, your jail, is still really
dark and really lonely.</p>
<p>After some time, you discover, behind a really heavy floor tile, a number of
levers.</p>
<p>Using these levers, you are able to make the room rock to and fro.</p>
<p>After some months of practice, you learn how to rock the room more
consistently, and move it in a certain direction.</p>
<p>When you do this, the rays of light coming in through the two pinprick holes
change in interesting ways.</p>
<p>Very slowly, over a period of years, you start figuring out that the rays of
light coming in through the two holes, and the sounds coming in through the
other holes, are often caused by other prisoners, all trapped in cells similar
to yours.</p>
<p>You start making <em>contact</em>.</p>
<h3 id="real-time-reality-synthesis">Real-time reality synthesis.</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to tell this story without giving it away of course.</p>
<p>Your brain is in fact trapped in a bony cage.</p>
<p>It has two slimy nerve bundles slithering out through two holes in your
skull. The ends of those nerve bundles are sensitive to photons falling on them
(light), and send electrical signals back along their bodies when this happens.</p>
<p>Your brain has more slimy nerve bundles connected to your ears.</p>
<p>Sound waves hitting your eardrums via a chain of contact end up as vibrations
in the fluid inside your cochleae, where another set of nerve endings are
stimulated and send more electrical signals back along their bodies.</p>
<p>Your whole body is criss-crossed by more of these bundles of super long
neurons.</p>
<p>Trapped in its terribly dark bony cage, your brain is a slimy mass that absorbs
all of the electrical signals coming back from your eyes, your ears, and the
rest of your nervous system.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s really not that much coming in folks.</p>
<p>However, somehow, somewhere inside of that slimy mass, &ldquo;you&rdquo; experience all of
this as a multi-coloured, high definition, surround-sound, smell-&lsquo;o-vision,
multi-million dollar 3D Hollywood movie.</p>
<p>When I look at the imbalance between the real-time sensory data coming in on
the one hand, and the incredible richness of the experience on the other, and
bolstered slightly by what I know about the human sensory system, I come to the
conclusion that the multi-million dollar experience is a result of an almost
perpetual hallucination.</p>
<p>In other words, the reality that we experience while awake is <em>seeded</em> by our
senses, but a large part of its verdant richness is synthesised, in real-time,
by our amazing brains.</p>
<p>Thinking about it this way, it is not so surprising that we are apparently able
to synthesise whole realities while we dream, including people, environments,
conversations, relationships and experiences, all in apparent real-time.</p>
<h3 id="ps-its-the-music">P.S. It&rsquo;s the music.</h3>
<p>This whole story came up in a conversation I recently had with my partner.</p>
<p>I was trying to explain that I easily get lost in thought with the right
music.</p>
<p>Heck, when I go running (for realz), I sometimes get utterly lost in my
imagination, and it&rsquo;s quite a visual, even multi-sensory affair.</p>
<p>During that conversation, I had the insight that when this happens (i.e. I get
lost in thought), it&rsquo;s only some of the lower bandwidth sensory feeds that are
suppressed and/or slightly disrupted, for example by the right music, enabling
the super deluxe reality synthesis equipment in my brain to do what it normally
does, only slightly less constrained by outside stimuli.</p>
<p>Taking this one step further, although one might be permanently hallucinating,
one does have some control over the balance between incoming feeds and internal
simulation.</p>
<p>In <a href="/2018/02/04/weekly-head-voices-130-2-direct-experience-dopamine/#your-brain-at-work-part-2-dopamine-and-more-mindfulness">direct experience
mode</a>,
one shifts more bandwidth to the incoming feeds.</p>
<p>(Internal simulation still has to fill in the multitude of blanks.)</p>
<p>Then, when one&rsquo;s imagination takes flight, incoming feeds are turned down
somewhat, enabling internal simulation to take over.</p>
<h2 id="row-row-row-your-boat">Row, row, row your boat.</h2>
<p>I wish you an amazing week, and I look forward to when we meet again.</p>
