Here I single out three of the tweets, but you should really read the whole thread:
When coding, I always maintain a journal in the repo (I happen to use Markdeep for this now) with a TODO list.
Tasks are at the level of one hour for &amp;ldquo;today&amp;rdquo; stuff, one day for next week, and then week- or longer level tasks.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>This weekend, Morgan McGuire, graphics and game programming god, <a href="https://twitter.com/CasualEffects/status/1241329539902570498">tweeted a
thread about his text journal based method of software development project
management</a>.</p>
<p>Here I single out three of the tweets, but you should really read the whole
thread:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When coding, I always maintain a journal in the repo (I happen to use Markdeep
for this now) with a TODO list.</p>
<p>Tasks are at the level of one hour for &ldquo;today&rdquo; stuff, one day for next week,
and then week- or longer level tasks.</p>
<p>I expand the details for the next week on Friday.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tweet 3:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I start working on the top, ~1-hour item, on the list, I immediately
expand it recursively until the subtasks are completely braindead to
implement.</p>
<p>I do all of the hard part of programming here, in the TODO list, figuring out
the library calls, designing the APIs, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tweet 4:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I get into the actual source code, I&rsquo;m just working from my own
walk-through on the TODO list, and I only need to think about syntax and code
cleanup. I can focus on programming legibly in the small instead of worrying
about the big picture.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He shows the following screenshot as an example:</p>

<p>This is such a brilliant way of doing the highest level &ldquo;programming&rdquo; in an
outlining tool, and then working one&rsquo;s way down until it&rsquo;s eventually time to
jump into the code.</p>
<p>I can also immediately see how well this would work in a team context.</p>
<p>During the planning session, the outline could be collaboratively fleshed
out. Furthermore, as McGuire states, it can be fleshed out differently
depending on the experience level of the team member.</p>
<p>This makes me wonder how much we as engineers <em>really</em> need the Jiras and the
YouTracks and the DevOpses of the world?</p>
<p>(Just joking folks, I know we need it, but perhaps we could do with a little
more MMMMM in our lives?)</p>
<h2 id="markdeep">Markdeep.</h2>
<p>Almost in passing McGuire mentions markdeep, the system he designed for
extremely agile technical documentation.</p>
<p>A friend from work introduced me to this years ago (thanks HB!), but then I
somehow missed its genius.</p>
<p>One of the core ideas that makes markdeep so interesting and useful, is that
the markdeep plaintext markup (it&rsquo;s like supercharged markdown) is embedded in
an extremely thin layer of HTML which invokes the markdeep.js renderer on
itself.</p>
<p>In other words, you edit the self-contained <code>.md.html</code> file with your favourite
text editor, but when you open this file in your browser, a single line of HTML
at the end pulls in <code>markdeep.min.js</code> from a CDN or from your local disc, and
renders the beautifully typeset version of the document.</p>
<p>As if that was not enough, markdeep has extensive support for the SVG rendering
of ascii art.</p>
<p>See the following pages for more information:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/">The Markdeep website</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/features.md.html">The extensive Markdeep demo
document</a> - especially
the <a href="https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/features.md.html#diagramexamples">diagram
examples</a>
are impressive!</li>
</ul>
<p>For my own notes I am sticking to <a href="https://orgmode.org/">Orgmode</a> (if you&rsquo;re an
emacs user, it&rsquo;s more powerful), but there will surely be situations where the
self-contained Markdeep makes more sense.</p>
<h2 id="the-graphics-codex">The Graphics Codex.</h2>
<p>Markdeep has been used to author a number of books, but <a href="http://graphicscodex.com/">The Graphics
Codex</a> must be one of the more amazing examples, in
terms of its interactivity and just general prettiness.</p>
<p>The iPhone app version looks like this:</p>

<p>I bought the web version not because I currently need a graphics reference, but
rather because it is a thing of beauty, and because I wanted to be able to see
better how it all works.</p>
