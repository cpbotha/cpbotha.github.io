<p>As mentioned around these parts, I’m currently playing with <a href="http://processing.org/" title="Processing website">Processing</a>, a beautiful programming stack for making interactive visual, err, thingies. To be more specific, I’d like to use processing together with something like ARToolkit to do real-time 3D tracking of markers in live video, for augmented reality fun.  To see what this could look like, see this YouTube video:</p>
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper">
<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe allowfullscreen="true" class="youtube-player" height="473" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uoncHfnYWHM?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" style="border:0;" type="text/html" width="840"></iframe></span>

<p>Today’s challenge is getting whole stack, including processing, the GSVideo video capture library for processing and the NyARToolkit augmented reality for processing going on Linux x86_64 (64bit).  On Linux x86 (32bit) this is much more straight-forward, but I wouldn’t write a blog post about straight-forward, now would I?</p>
<p>Here is the recipe:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Make sure you have the native 64bit Sun JDK installed for your system.  On this Ubuntu 9.10 machine it’s ﻿﻿﻿sun-java6-jdk 6-15-1, on Ubuntu 10.04 (also tested) it’s ﻿6.20dlj-1ubuntu3.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also install the jogl libraries, on this machine called libjogl-java.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure you have the whole of gstreamer installed. On ubuntu, all packages containing “gstreamer”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get and unpack the processing for Linux tarball (I’ve tested this whole procedure with processing 1.0.9, 1.1 and 1.2.1) from the processing <a href="http://processing.org/download/" title="processing download site">download site</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the unpacked processing directory, remove the whole java subdirectory. Now make a symlink pointing to your system java directory (the one containing bin, ext, jre, lib, etc.).  On my system, that was: <pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate" title="">cd processing
rm -rf java
ln -s /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-1.6.0.15﻿ java
</pre></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In processing/libraries/opengl/library remove the 3 libjogl*.so files and libgluegen-rt.so. Symlink their replacements from /usr/lib/jni with for example: <pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate" title="">cd processing/libraries/opengl/library
rm lib*.so
ln -s /usr/lib/jni/libgluegen-rt.so
ln -s /usr/lib/jni/libjogl_awt.so
ln -s /usr/lib/jni/libjogl.so
</pre></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://users.design.ucla.edu/~acolubri/processing/gsvideo/home/" title="GSVideo website">Download</a> and unpack gsvideo into processing/libraries.  You should be able to run the examples in processing/libraries/gsvideo/examples/Capture with the PDE (Processing Development Environment).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://nyatla.jp/nyartoolkit/wiki/index.php?NyAR4psg.en" title="NyARToolkit for Processing website">Download</a> and unpack the NyARToolkit for Processing library into processing/libraries.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You should now be able to run the NyARToolkit examples by changing replacing the import call as follows:</p>
<pre class="brush: java; title: ; notranslate" title="">// replace this call:
// import processing.video.*;
// by this call:
import codeanticode.gsvideo.*;
</pre>
<p>and changing the Capture class (twice) to GSCapture and perhaps also the capture resolution, depending on your camera. The relevant conversions are:</p>
<pre class="brush: java; title: ; notranslate" title="">// Capture cam;
// becomes:
GSCapture cam;

// later, in setup():
// cam=new Capture(this,width,height);
// becomes:
cam=new GSCapture(this,width,height);
</pre>
<p>The major trick in all of this is converting your Processing installation to use your system 64bit JDK instead of its own built-in 32bit JDK.</p>
<p>Let me know in the comments if this worked (or didn’t) for you!</p>
