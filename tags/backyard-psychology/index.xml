<h2 id="emacs-mastodon-server-was-irresistible">Emacs Mastodon server was irresistible</h2>
<p>A week or two ago, I was still chatting with friends about how to respond to
the currently in-progress Twitter Muskification.</p>
<p>At that point, largely due to all of the great connections and positive
experience I&rsquo;ve been enjoying on twitter (howto: follow only kind humans who
are involved in your fields of interest; in my case visualization, machine
learning, data, mobility), I commented that I had no plans yet and preferred
waiting for a bit to see how it would pan out.</p>
<p>The topic of <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a> did come up, but the feeling in that tech-savvy group was
that it was perhaps a bit complicated.</p>
<p>In the days since then, the developments at Twitter seemed to have accelerated,
but it&rsquo;s still extremely tricky to predict where all of this will end up.</p>
<p>Also in the days since then, a Swiss gentleman named <a href="https://emacs.ch/@louis">Louis</a> had the nerve ;) to
setup a Mastodon server called <a href="https://emacs.ch">emacs.ch</a>, catering to Emacs enthusiasts&hellip;</p>
<p>CURSES!</p>
<p>I see Emacs, I move.</p>
<p>My account was created a few minutes later, and suddenly Mastodon was not
complicated at all y&rsquo;all!</p>
<p>Things that I really like so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anyone can setup an independent yet connected server that caters to a
specific interest group, such as Emacs users.</li>
<li>Much more engagement and connectedness with other users, thanks to the server
focus.</li>
<li>Early internet feelings: Optimism, grassroots, people.</li>
<li>Fantastic Emacs support. I can <a href="https://emacs.ch/@cpbotha/109337719793270417">read and post directly from Emacs, using the
amazing <code>mastodon.el</code></a>.</li>
<li>No algorithm that re-arranges the posts that you see. What you see is what
your timeline posted, when they posted it.</li>
<li>No ads!</li>
<li>Yes, here you <strong>can</strong> edit your posts after you&rsquo;ve posted them. IT&rsquo;S TRUE.</li>
<li>NO ADS!</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been having fun tracking down friends and colleagues on their various
mastodon servers, and re-making connections.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re also interested, my advice would be to start by <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/servers">searching for a
server</a> (or more than one!) that really suits you.</p>
<p>Then, if you like, you can find <em>me</em> at <a href="https://emacs.ch/@cpbotha">@cpbotha@emacs.ch</a> !</p>
<h2 id="quarto-dot-qmd-looks-like-the-answer-to-my-dot-ipynb-prayers">Quarto .qmd looks like the answer to my .ipynb prayers</h2>
<p>Back in 2018 I talked about <a href="/2018/07/17/weekly-head-voices-148-data-stylist/#vacation-based-thinking-driven-tool-sharpening-aka-the-wvv-2018-data-science-toolboxtm">my complicated feelings for Jupyter Notebooks</a>.</p>
<p>To elaborate a bit, I still do think notebooks are amazing, but they are so
amazing that their design limitations can get in the way.</p>
<p>Most recently, the .ipynb format, which is standard .json representing the
various input cells (code and markdown mainly) and also their outputs (yikes!),
caused issues at work.</p>
<p>Although it&rsquo;s convenient from a notebook user standpoint that you can open up
an ipynb and see the last rendered version of the notebook, it really
complicates source control (diffs), and opening the .ipynb up in a normal
editor to debug issues is not fun at all.</p>
<p>Well, recently, spurred on by the below provocative tweet by Chelsea
Parlett-Pelleriti (who is now also on Mastodon as
<a href="https://nerdculture.de/@chelseaparlett">@chelseaparlett@nerdculture.de</a>):</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Friendship ended with .rmd<br><br>now .qmd is my best friend <a href="https://t.co/7ETH4o2KUH">pic.twitter.com/7ETH4o2KUH</a></p>&mdash; Chelsea @chelseaparlett@nerdculture.de (@ChelseaParlett) <a href="https://twitter.com/ChelseaParlett/status/1591505992805543936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 12, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>&hellip; I decided to take a deeper look at Quarto and especially .qmd.</p>
<p>In short, .qmd is markdown with executable code-cells!</p>
<p>If you take a look at the VSCode-based <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/vscode.html">Get Started guide</a>, you&rsquo;ll see that can
type up .qmd files in any text editor, and then have the quarto cli tool show
you a continuous preview of your work.</p>
<p>The examples they show look <em>really</em> attractive folks!</p>
<p>One of the fundamental improvements here, is that by design outputs are not
stored inside the .qmd file format.</p>
<p>An addition, the top-to-bottom execution of one&rsquo;s notebook is the primary mode
of operation, although cell-based execution is also possible. This is the
opposite of normal notebooks, where the default interactive cell-based
execution often results in the top-to-bottom not being tested, and hence often
being broken.</p>
<p>For my current analytics applications, it looks like we&rsquo;ll be able to use .qmd
as a drop-in replacement for .ipynb.</p>
<p>Although Org mode and org-babel have been doing this (plaintext file with
executable code cells) for a long time now, I am really excited that there&rsquo;s
now a more accessible solution that will hopefully become very popular.</p>
<p>P.S. After all of that, I was additionally thrilled to discover that Dr Carlos
Scheidegger, a brilliant and friendly colleague from the the data visualization
world, was on the core developer team. Here he is <a href="https://emacs.ch/@scheidegger@mastodon.social/109343921680547594">announcing, on Mastodon, the
just-released v1.2 of Quarto</a>!</p>
<h2 id="self-discipline">Self-discipline</h2>
<p>Picture this:</p>
<p>You wake up in the morning, refreshed and ready to take on the day.</p>
<p>With your mind as clear as it&rsquo;ll ever be, you make a list of the things that
you know that you should work on today: Let&rsquo;s call them Things A, B, C and H.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re really passionate about A, but you realise that B and C are at least as
important to your and your family&rsquo;s well-being.</p>
<p>H is just something urgent that you&rsquo;ve postponed for too long and now really
has to be taken care of, or perhaps the H stands for Harbinger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harbinger of what?&rdquo; I hear you think&hellip;</p>
<p>Shortly after this moment of clarity, the day (on some days aka &ldquo;all Hell&rdquo;)
breaks loose and you suddenly have to deal with all of the vagaries of modern
work and life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s starting to feel like the crystalline clarity of a few moments ago might
be just a little too brittle to resist the deluge of chaos.</p>
<p>On your <em>better</em> days, you will be able to keep your eye on Thing A, in spite of
all of the obstacles that stand in your path. Your passion for A helps you to
power through.</p>
<p>On your <em>best</em> days, you will find that quiet determination inside, that modest
but diamond-hard resolve that will enable you to tend to Things B and C in
addition to A, with deliberateness and diligence.</p>
<p>In my view, being able to focus on your passions in spite of challenges on your
path sounds like <strong><em>grit</em></strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip; grit is a positive, non-cognitive trait based on an individual&rsquo;s
perseverance of effort combined with the passion for a particular long-term
goal or end state (a powerful motivation to achieve an objective). This
perseverance of effort promotes the overcoming of obstacles or challenges that
lie on the path to accomplishment and serves as a driving force in achievement
realization. Distinct but commonly associated concepts within the field of
psychology include &ldquo;perseverance&rdquo;, &ldquo;hardiness&rdquo;, &ldquo;resilience&rdquo;, &ldquo;ambition&rdquo;, &ldquo;need
for achievement&rdquo; and &ldquo;conscientiousness&rdquo;. These constructs can be
conceptualized as individual differences related to the accomplishment of work
rather than talent or ability. &ndash; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grit_(personality_trait)">Wikipedia on &ldquo;grit&rdquo;</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whereas I would label the characteristic of being able to continue paying
attention to things that are important but not necessarily your areas of
passion <strong><em>self-discipline</em></strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Resolute adherence to a regimen or course of action in order to achieve one&rsquo;s
goals. &ndash; <a href="https://dictionary.apa.org/self-discipline">definition #2 from the APA Dictionary of Psychology</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Definition #1 on that page is <em>self-control</em>, which seems to be the passive
counterpart (or component) of <em>self-discipline</em>, based on what I can find
online. Unfortunately, what I can find online are mostly second- and third-hand
observations, see e.g. <a href="https://fredericksburg.com/self-control-and-self-discipline-arent-the-same/article_9e91991c-81e8-5a8f-bca0-972e025fbe24.html">quote by Dr. Julia-Marie O&rsquo;Brien #1 without citation</a>,
<a href="https://matthogan.blog/self-discipline-vs-self-control/">same quote #2</a>, <a href="https://selfctrl.com/3-lessons-learned-on-building-self-control/">same quote #3</a> or <a href="https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-difference-between-self-control-and-self-discipline">quora, sorry!</a> &ndash; &ldquo;Self-control says no, or
stop. Self-discipline says go, and keep it going.&rdquo; &ndash; Although I would like to
find better discussion about this, the distinction does make sense.)</p>
<p>Self-discipline is one of those skills that can be practised.</p>
<p>By applying it more often, and especially so when it feels like the going has
gotten tough, you&rsquo;ll be able to apply it more reliably and more consistently in
the future.</p>
<p>Self-discipline is the reliable bridge linking you and your goals, at your
absolute best, with you at all other points.</p>
<p>It can be difficult to keep on practising, but when you can look back on one of
<em>those</em> days, and see how you even managed to take care of Things B and C, in
addition to A, in spite of the adversities on your path, you will experience
quiet satisfaction.</p>
<p>Savour the moment.</p>

<h2 id="lecturing-old-school">Lecturing, old school.</h2>
<p>On Thursday, November 21, I gave a two hour lecture titled &ldquo;IoMT in Healthcare
Innovation&rdquo; at the <a href="https://www.usb.ac.za/">University of Stellenbosch Business
School</a>.</p>
<p>IoMT expands to the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2018/01/25/why-the-internet-of-medical-things-iomt-will-start-to-transform-healthcare-in-2018/#46f18c694a3c">&ldquo;Internet of Medical
Things&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>My knowledge of IoT is spotty, and before giving this lecture I didn&rsquo;t even
know that the term &ldquo;IoMT&rdquo; existed.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it turns out that a lot of what we&rsquo;re currently doing at Stone
Three Healthcare (connecting patients with specialist care through
diagnostic-grade streaming of auscultation (and soon other modalities) device
data) can in fact be classified as IoMT.</p>
<p>Phew.</p>
<p>I would like to make the following observations based on this experience:</p>
<ol>
<li>I still really love getting up in front of a group of people to present
something. There are so many things that could go wrong, but when they go
right, the experience is great.</li>
<li>A two hour lecture is quite long, for both the students, even when they&rsquo;re
as advanced as this, <em>and</em> for the lecturer, especially when he is as out of
practice as this.
<ul>
<li>If there&rsquo;s a next time, I will either insert my own 15 minute break, or I
will get the class to break out into some sort of topic-strengthening
activity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I had somehow forgotten how much time lecture preparation could take up,
even when you just had to present your own day-to-day reality.
<ul>
<li>BIG UP TO THE LECTURERS IN THE WHV AUDIENCE!</li>
</ul>

<p>Last Sunday morning, as the family took a last swim at Kraalbaai before we had
to return home, I tried to apply some serious thinking (well, I did this by
stringing together a series of normal thinking moments) to the problem of
increasing my efficiency and focus at work.</p>
<p>At that moment, the scenery outside looked like this:</p>

<p>Regular readers will know that coming up with new ways to increase and maintain
focus is a life-long endeavour, which my subconscious self enjoys inventing
interesting new ways to subvert.</p>
<p>Conscious me has made peace with the fact that it has no choice but to keep on
working at its end of the bargain, until the very end.</p>
<p>With the opposing forces involved, my focus seems to oscillate with varying
frequencies between terrible and not too bad.</p>
<p>Anyways, having had a few days of fresh air and majestic scenery to jog the
neural circuitry, I applied myself, again, to the problem at hand.</p>
<p>I thought that sketching could help, so I was scribbling using a rather
impressive electronic pencil-analogue on a glass screen.</p>
<p>After several focused minutes (SEVERAL MINUTES, I TELL YOU!), I had a mindmap
with &ldquo;increase efficiency&rdquo; in a little oval at the center, arrows pointing
outwards into three terribly familiar habits, each in a rectangle <em>this</em> time,
and finally more connecting lines to lists of pretty plausible sounding reasons
for the three well-known habits.</p>
<p>The three rectangles were:</p>
<ol>
<li>Morning planning.</li>
<li>Inbox 0.</li>
<li>Pomodoro always.</li>
</ol>
<p>Over the years, these three items have made pretty regular appearances, in
various different forms, on this blog.</p>
<p>(I laughed when I just looked up <a href="/2010/09/20/an-indecent-proposal-weekly-head-voices-31/">this old 2010
post</a> and found a
pretty effective focus technique in the comments.)</p>
<p>Anyways, although the little thinking and drawing session documented here
seemingly did not result in any new revelations, the act of going through the
whole thought process, and documenting the results (again), seemed to have
contributed to a pretty great week in terms of focus.</p>
<p>I wrote down a little mantra for myself (definitely not fit for publication),
weaving together the three points above and the reasoning behind them, almost
like the affirmation in Wreckit Ralph&rsquo;s bad guy support group:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m bad, and that&rsquo;s good. I will never be good, and that&rsquo;s not bad. There&rsquo;s
no one I&rsquo;d rather be than me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the most valuable lessons I learned from a book I once read about
procrastination (I&rsquo;ll look up the name later), is that it can make all the
difference once you explicitly verbalise, to yourself, that you have <em>chosen</em>
to take on difficult task X or Y.</p>
<p>Just saying these words somehow changes one&rsquo;s perception from being stuck with
difficult task X or Y, i.e. passive, to having taken agency, and having <em>decided</em>
to <em>commit</em>, i.e. active.</p>
<p>My humble focus mantra is following in this tradition.</p>
<p>(I really hope that my subversive sub-conscious is not paying attention right
now&hellip;)</p>
<h2 id="starship-gou-1-taxiing-on-the-runway">Starship GOU #1, taxiing on the runway.</h2>
<p>Wednesday, December 4, was officially <a href="/about/weekly-head-voices-abbreviations/">GOU
#1&rsquo;s</a> last day of primary school.</p>
<p>Although she seemed to navigate this emotional event with her customary
even-keeled demeanour, some of the moments were really just too big to let go by
without a good cry or two.</p>
<p>I was also happy to observe the level of retrospection and sunny candour she
applied to her informal post hoc analyses of above-mentioned crying moments.</p>
<p>I really hope that she strengthens and maintains this important human ability.</p>
<p>From our perspective as parents, it feels like the stakes are being raised
quite significantly.</p>
<p>The thing is, our oldest is now quite obviously becoming an adult.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like that scene at the end of the brilliant 2015 movie <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2096673/">Inside
Out</a>, where the protagonist&rsquo;s brain
console is suddenly upgraded to one with at least 9000 new knobs and dials.</p>
<p>Up to now, we (the parents) were GOU #1&rsquo;s only control system.</p>
<p>Now it is becoming quite clear that she is increasingly forming her own
opinions, and making her own decisions.</p>
<p>In most cases, the physical constraints of a 13 year old living in her parent&rsquo;s
house still afford us some level of control.</p>
<p>However, relying on that would be missing the point entirely.</p>
<p>You see, we find ourselves in the moment of truth, when the past 13 years of
mostly gentle programming has to start executing all by itself.</p>
<p>Our little GOU #1, our first co-created human intelligence, is preparing to go
out into the world.</p>
<p>She has not taken off yet, so we do our best to apply the final touches to her
already promising software.</p>
<p>We exhort her regularly: <em>Be useful. Use your (rational) brain. Be kind. Find
the kindness in others.</em></p>
<p>In the darkness, when we are at our weakest, stripped down to our core, we do
what all parents do:</p>
<p>We worry, and we hope with a passion, the intensity of which it is difficult to
describe, that our offspring units do manage to <a href="/2012/03/04/rhythm-of-the-night-weekly-head-voices-66/#life-philosophy-that-works">generate their own motivation,
to manufacture meaning, and to create
love</a>.</p>

<h1 id="c-quo-vadis">C++ quo vadis?</h1>
<p>This week, we spent more than a day chasing an elusive memory-related access violation (big words for “crash”) in the software we recently released.</p>
<p>In the end, the bug was only really reproducible on Windows 7 (not on Linux, not on macOS, and only with great difficulty and infinite patience on Windows 10). It turned out to be hidden deep in a well-tested, industry-backed open source C++ library.</p>
<p>This and the specific nature of this bug again demonstrated to me that C++, although I love it dearly, simply has too many well-disguised flaws (let’s call them foot-guns) which will eventually lead to even the most experienced and sharp programmer making mistakes.</p>
<p>In spite of the recent language renaissance (C++11, 14, 17 with 20 imminent) and a slew of improvements, it’s still too easy to write unsafe code.</p>
<p>With contenders like rust (<a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/">rustlang</a> AJ, rustlang!) which enable programmers to write programmes which have C++-level performance but are by default safe, could C++’s days be counted?</p>
<h1 id="run">Run</h1>
<p>It was time to retire my trusty pair of Asics Cumulus 18 shoes.</p>
<p>They had clocked just over 900km, which is perhaps a little too much. By the end, I could feel the bones in my big toe’s main joint (apparently also known as the big-toe’s MTP or metatarsophalangeal joint) crunching down with each strike.</p>
<p>Normally not prone to these types of visits, I had no choice but to pop out to the <a href="https://www.runspecialiststore.com/">Run Specialist Store</a> in Edward street on Thursday to get a new pair of activity-proof foot covers.</p>
<p>They let me run on a treadmill (whoohooo running!) with a high-speed video camera. In the footage, we could see that indeed my conversion to forefoot running had been successful (which was good to hear, because it had cost me about 100km of pain), but that I tended to land on the outsides of my forefeet.</p>
<p>The minimal shoes I had had in mind were not (yet) to be.</p>
<p>Instead the run doctor prescribed a pair of <a href="https://www.solereview.com/saucony-kinvara-8-review/">Saucony Kinvara 8s</a>, which make my old Asics look like previous generation gardening shoes. I’ve since taken these out on two runs. They are super light, and super springy (everun FTW?), but I have to say that I have my doubts about the durability of the outsole. I’ll report back.</p>
<p>In February, I’m pretty happy that I managed to squeeze in just over 110km of running, which is not too shabby (by my standards, as always!) for the short month.</p>
<h1 id="scarf">SCARF</h1>
<p>Yes, winter is coming, but this, although also quite useful, is not that type of SCARF.</p>
<p>I am still reading <a href="https://your-brain-at-work.com/">David Rock’s book Your Brain at Work</a>, and SCARF is his mnemonic for Status, Certainty, Autonomy, Relatedness and Fairness.</p>
<p>These are five social needs, the threat or confirmation of which can have profound effects on humans.</p>
<p>If you feel that you are being unfairly treated, for example, this triggers a low-level threat response which fundamentally complicates dealing rationally with a situation.</p>
<p>Conversely, if for example an interaction grants you more certainty or even better autonomy, you are magically able to contribute significantly more cognitive capacity and creativity to that interaction.</p>
<p>Both the fundamental threat and reward responses go for all five of these qualities. Once you know what to look for, it’s easy to go through some of your memories and to see where one or more of the SCARF needs played a role.</p>
<p>Although one (hopefully) mostly intuitively integrates this in one’s daily dealings, I think it’s super useful being able to enumerate the SCARF social needs like this. It helps when managing oneself in any situation (especially when your prefrontal cortex is exhausted, which is just about always), and it certainly helps when you might find yourself in position where you are able to contribute to another human’s well-being.</p>
<h1 id="the-end">The end</h1>
<p>Have a great week friends, I hope to see you again soon!</p>
<p>P.S. if there are any arduino uno -&gt; hardware serial -&gt; xbee experts in the audience, I would like to have a word. (<a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12847">sparkfun shield</a>. with software serial can talk to xbee. with hardware serial, and sparkfun switch in the right position, xbee won’t respond. <a href="https://medium.com/@phurl/robotdyn-uno-vs-arduino-genuino-uno-a9ac3b17a96f">uno is a robotdyn clone</a>.)</p>

<p>The week of Monday June 15 to Sunday June 21 in bullets:</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>
    Ran around organizing all kinds of things for the new house. The various institutions have been cooperating <i>very</i> nicely.
  </li>
<li>
    Spent days trying first to fix an implementation of a <a href="http://www.chrisoat.com/papers/Oat-Tatarchuk-Isidoro-Layered_Car_Paint_Shader_Print.pdf">GPU algorithm to simulate car paint</a>, and then to implement an alternative algorithm by the clever boys and girls at NVIDIA. A team-mate finally got everything working by realising that the float16 texture coordinates (long story) we were using to sample a noise texture needed to be float32. Lesson learnt: If you’re seeing splotches when you’re supposed to be seeing snow, check your float precision!
  </li>
<li>
    Spent the rest of the week fighting with <a href="http://wkhtmltopdf.org/">wkhtmltopdf</a>, a tool that converts HTML into PDF. Unfortunately the tool is 50% webkit, and 50% black magic. Lesson learnt: wkhtmltopdf 0.12.2.1 renders internally at 74.8dpi. Accept it, calculate with it, and move on. The upshot of this is that the <a href="http://www.patinformatics.com/blog/next-generation-ng-ip-and-rd-dashboard-a-joint-development-by-evalueserve-and-treparel/">IP Dashboard</a> is now 37% better at exporting charts.
  </li>

    For some time now, when I have to make decisions, I actively optimise for experiences and not for possessions. At some point in the past I read in the blogosphere that experiences make people happier than possessions, and since then I’ve been paying more attention to this. IT REALLY WORKS!(tm) Tonight I wanted to look up the sources of this idea for you (and for me). Here are the two academic papers causing most of that online discussion, and a summarising blog post:: <ul class="org-ul">
<li>
<a href="http://cornellpsych.org/people/travis/materials/Carter-Gilovich-Relative%20Relativity-JPSP-2010.pdf"><i>The Relative Relativity of Material and Experiential Purchases</i></a> (2010), Travis J. Carter and Thomas Gilovich.
      </li>
<li>
<a href="http://cornellpsych.org/people/travis/materials/Carter-Gilovich-Material%20Experiential%20Identity-JPSP-2012.pdf"><i>I Am What I Do, Not What I Have: The Differential Centrality of Experiential and Material Purchases to the Self</i></a> (2012), Travis J. Carter and Thomas Gilovich.
      </li>
<li>
<a href="http://phys.org/news/2010-03-study-shows-experiences-are-better.html">Study shows experiences are better than possessions</a> -- summarising post on phys.org. Carter and Gilovich’s research (based on on a number of tests and questionnaires they did with a sample of Cornell students) demonstrated that experiences were more satisfying than possessions. Their results also support at least one explanatory mechanism: Experiences are more closely connected to the self. This makes sense: Anybody else can buy the same thing you bought, but, by definition, your experience of some event or adventure is quite unique to you. To my mind, the idea of focusing on the experience rather than the cake at the end is pleasingly complementary to the adage that <i>Life is a journey, not a destination</i>, which I have just learned is due to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/24142-life-is-a-journey-not-a-destination">Ralph Waldo Emerson</a>.
</li>
</ul>

    I’m still terrible at bullets, I know.

<p>Dear reader(s), have a beautiful and experience-filled week!</p>
