In the process of dealing with recent(ish) life-changing decisions, but probably more due to the preceding time of introspection, I was unable to enter the right state of mind for producing the weekly WHV episodes. However, because exciting new events have been scheduled for the coming months and I really look forward to writing about them, and because I’ve decided that, yes, I shouldn’t worry too much about the actual literary impact of this here blog (I wrote “bog” first, I hope that it wasn’t a Freudian slip; what I was actually intending to say between these parentheses is that I will continue to do my best to entertain and/or edify!), the time has come to get the WHV back on the road!</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>Dear two people reading this blog on a good day: Spread the word, the Weekly Head Voices is making a comeback!</p>
<p>In the process of dealing with recent(ish) <a href="/2013/03/09/dear-academia-i-hope-we-can-still-be-friends/" title="The Leaving Academia Post(tm)">life-changing decisions</a>, but probably more due to the preceding time of introspection, I was unable to enter the right state of mind for producing the weekly WHV episodes. However, because exciting new events have been scheduled for the coming months and I really look forward to writing about them, and because I’ve decided that, yes, I shouldn’t worry <strong>too</strong> much about the actual literary impact of this here blog (I wrote “bog” first, I hope that it wasn’t a Freudian slip; what I was actually intending to say between these parentheses is that I will continue to do my best to entertain and/or edify!), the time has come to get the WHV back on the road!</p>
<p>For the past weeks, I have been burning all kinds of midnight oil on different projects. For one of them, I’ve had to design a reusable JS architecture for customizable visualizations (of course using the awesome <a href="http://d3js.org/" title="d3.js">d3.js</a>). During one of these weeks, I saw a rip-off of the <a href="https://twitter.com/boltcity/status/369484217349992448" title="original creative process tweet">following tweet, the original 140 character guide to the creative process</a>:

<p>The stages of the creative process are: <em>1) This is going to be awesome 2) This is hard 3) This is terrible 4) I’m terrible 5) Hey, not bad 6) That was awesome.</em></p>
<p>At that time, I found myself squarely in stage 4: <strong>I AM TERRIBLE.</strong></p>
<p>However, just reading this and then realising that that’s just how it has to work made me feel much better. Fast-forward to a week or so later, and I seem to find myself in stage 5. Stage 5 is not the best, but man does it feel infinitely better than stage 4. (If you run into me at any of the numerous bars, parties and other social events I frequent, ask me about the design.) Remember this process the next time you’re in the middle of something complicated.</p>
<p><em>(I was not able to come up with any kind of bridge between the creative process and my next point. I’m open to suggestions in the comments! For now, just imagine some pithy or really clever literary topic-jumping device here, ok?)</em></p>
<p>As the more astute readers should know (I guess that’s both of you), <em>I</em> was naturally into mindfulness before it got all hip. See my 2011 post on <a href="/2011/03/19/drown-in-the-now-weekly-head-voices-42/" title="drown in the now">drowning in the now</a>, and my 2010 post on <a href="/2010/11/28/focus-weekly-head-voices-34/" title="focus post">focus</a> if you don’t believe me. However, I wanted to get into it more formally, so I acquired and started practising with one of the better books on the topic: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mindfulness-practical-guide-peace-frantic-ebook/dp/B004XCFJ3E/" title="mindfulness book on amazon"><em>Mindfulness: A practical guide to peace in a frantic world</em></a>. There are at least two things I really like about mindfulness:</p>
<ol>
<li>There’s quite a bit of solid research on mindfulness and its effects on your brain. See for example the publications on <a href="http://www.psych.ox.ac.uk/team/PIs/mark-williams" title="website mark williams">the website of Prof. Mark Williams</a>, first author of the book above.</li>
<li>The idea that practising different ways of applying one’s intellect (conventional <em>doing</em> vs. the mindful <em>being</em>) leads to the ability to enter these modes at will, thus getting more control over one’s emotions, especially appeals to me. (Click <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spock">here</a> to meet one of my most important role models. For real.)</li>
</ol>
<p>The mindfulness book also discusses research on the interaction between one’s body and one’s emotional state. If you’re feeling down, your body starts acting up. Conversely, your physical state has a significant influence your emotional state. The upshot of this is that if you put a smile on your face, even if you’re not feeling particularly upbeat, <strong><em>Science</em></strong> says that you’ll really start to feel happier. If you’re already happy, it’s just going to consolidate those good vibes.</p>
<p>With that in mind, here’s my simple suggestion for today (and the rest of the year, and maybe next year): Let’s all smile as often as we can!</p>

<p>This edition of the Weekly Head Voices is almost 100% backyard philosophy, and more specifically is concerned with the meta-physical state <a data-rel="lightbox-video-0" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx1cYUb-0f4" title="YouTube clip of Die Antwoord describing Zef, Full Flex and The Next Level. Watch at your own risk.">some</a> (language NSFW), in a brilliant exercise in post-modernistic satire, call The Next Level.  Let’s take a gentle start.</p>
<p>First have a look at this mobile phone:</p>
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper">
<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe allowfullscreen="true" class="youtube-player" height="473" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ylFb4pqAUd8?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" style="border:0;" type="text/html" width="840"></iframe></span>
</div>
<p>The phone is not only glaring at a Rubik’s Cube, but IT’S PHYSICALLY SOLVING THE THING without even breaking a sweat, or begging for a battery recharge.  This phone has clearly reached the Next Level (of phones).</p>
<p>Then check out this robot:</p>
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper">
<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe allowfullscreen="true" class="youtube-player" height="473" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bI06lujiD7E?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" style="border:0;" type="text/html" width="840"></iframe></span>

<p>Yes people, the robot is able to move by HAPPILY BALANCING ON A BALL, even recovering from a shove by its future human slave. That’s pure robot hardcore, and definitely a robot that’s reached the Next Level.</p>
<p>Humans have a next level too. Because we currently seem to be by far the dominant life-form on our sensory horizons, striving for this is a slightly more complex endeavour than being able to balance on a ball like that robot.  So how can we strive for the next level?</p>
<p>For a start, take a look at this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases" title="List of cognitive biases on wikipedia.">list of cognitive biases on wikipedia</a>. In essence, most humans are basically walking meat bags filled with misunderstandings, and convinced that they’re not. Related to this, and funny in a tragic kind of way, is the <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2010/05/12/confident-dumb-peopl.html" title="Dunning-Kruger effect on boingboing">Dunning-Kruger effect</a>, which boils down to the fact that people who are incompetent, are by nature even less capable of recognising their own incompetence (vaccine / main-stream health denialists and climate change denialists are textbook cases of this). In any case, one would be taking a really big step up the ladder to the next level if one were to memorise the list of cognitive biases above, and were to work really hard every day at trying to compensate for some of these effects in oneself.</p>
<p>Generalising this idea, I think a really great life philosophy is simply to strive every day to be better at something than you were the day before: Cycle a bit faster, remember better, think and see more clearly, be kinder. If one were to keep this up throughout one’s life, one will probably end up in a Very Good Place (philosophically that is).</p>
<p>Something else that one can try to practise in one’s journey to the mythical next level is meditation.  A friend recently posted the following Google TechTalk by Philippe Goldin on the neuroscience behind mindfulness meditation.  It’s 50 minutes long, so feel free to watch it after you finish reading this post:</p>
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper">
<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe allowfullscreen="true" class="youtube-player" height="473" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sf6Q0G1iHBI?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" style="border:0;" type="text/html" width="840"></iframe></span>

<p>I wasn’t aware that what I was doing in essence comes down to mindfulness meditation.  In contrast to concentration meditation, where the goal is focusing on the same thing (a mantra, an object) the whole time, mindfulness is about opening the mind and letting <em>the now</em> flow in, appreciating and mentally tasting it without judging.  Although alternative health sites already claim the world (as with all things alternative health, you should ignore these without hesitation), science is <a href="http://www.skepsis.nl/mindfulness.html" title="skepsis article">cautiously optimistic</a> about the effects of mindfulness, in spite of the sub-standard quality of many of the studies.  There do seem to be definite personal benefits, and personally I am of the opinion that any form of regular meditation or focused self-reflection is an important catalyst in striving for the next level.</p>
<p>The same phenomenon currently disrupting my sleep and concentration, is very much related to this whole discussion, and probably caused it. Whilst it has justifiably been remarked that the act of procreation certainly doesn’t require a rocket scientist (on the contrary, sometimes), helping to sculpt the initial result into a potentially <em>next level human being</em> is an exquisite form of art that requires decennia for the completion of a single piece.</p>
<p>Thank you for stopping by to hear me ramble on, and please turn this into a real discussion by leaving a comment!</p>
