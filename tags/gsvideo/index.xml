[GSVideo][4] is a brilliant library that you can use in [processing][5] to capture live video, on Windows, Linux and OSX, and it’s a huge improvement over the built-in capturing support. Unfortunately, a number of us (including some of the 123 students we got to build augmented reality music instruments this September) have been running into a problematic frame error crash that meant captures didn’t last for very long before unceremoniously crashing the application.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p><em>Nerd warning: This post really belongs on my nerd blog <a href="http://vxlabs.com/" title="VXLabs.com, my favourite nerd blog!">VXLabs.com</a>, but as this blog has a rich tradition of popular [processing posts][2], I’m posting it here.</em></p>

<p>Read more about it on this [forum thread][6].</p>
<p>In any case, today I spent some hours I don’t really have and finally managed to crush it. Turns out, and some of you will probably not be surprised, that it was a threading problem. The capture event handler invokeEvent() and the read() call were being interleaved, and the buffer they were using is also not thread-safe. Doh. Some synchronization here and there, and an extra capture buffer, now I can’t get it to crash anymore.</p>
<p>Get the [patch here][7], and a [patched GSVideo.jar][8] here. Both of these are for the GSVideo 20110203 test version. If you can’t patch and build it yourself, just copy my GSVideo.jar over the GSVideo.jar in your unpacked GSVideo 20110203 plugin directory (sub-directory library). <strong>Update: See below, GSVideo 0.8 has been released and now contains my patch. Rather get the 0.8 download!</strong></p>
<p>Leave me a comment if this helps!</p>
<h3 id="update-on-2011-03-06">Update on 2011-03-06</h3>
<p>Andres Colubri, author of GSVideo, has refined and [integrated][9] my patch. The next GSVideo release (0.8 and newer) should have this fix.</p>
<h3 id="update-on-2011-03-15">Update on 2011-03-15</h3>
<p>Andres has just released GSVideo 0.8, which integrates my fix and many other improvements. Go read his [0.8 release post][10]!</p>

<p>As mentioned around these parts, I’m currently playing with <a href="http://processing.org/" title="Processing website">Processing</a>, a beautiful programming stack for making interactive visual, err, thingies. To be more specific, I’d like to use processing together with something like ARToolkit to do real-time 3D tracking of markers in live video, for augmented reality fun.  To see what this could look like, see this YouTube video:</p>
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper">
<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe allowfullscreen="true" class="youtube-player" height="473" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uoncHfnYWHM?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" style="border:0;" type="text/html" width="840"></iframe></span>
</div>
<p>Today’s challenge is getting whole stack, including processing, the GSVideo video capture library for processing and the NyARToolkit augmented reality for processing going on Linux x86_64 (64bit).  On Linux x86 (32bit) this is much more straight-forward, but I wouldn’t write a blog post about straight-forward, now would I?</p>
<p>Here is the recipe:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Make sure you have the native 64bit Sun JDK installed for your system.  On this Ubuntu 9.10 machine it’s ﻿﻿﻿sun-java6-jdk 6-15-1, on Ubuntu 10.04 (also tested) it’s ﻿6.20dlj-1ubuntu3.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also install the jogl libraries, on this machine called libjogl-java.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure you have the whole of gstreamer installed. On ubuntu, all packages containing “gstreamer”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get and unpack the processing for Linux tarball (I’ve tested this whole procedure with processing 1.0.9, 1.1 and 1.2.1) from the processing <a href="http://processing.org/download/" title="processing download site">download site</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the unpacked processing directory, remove the whole java subdirectory. Now make a symlink pointing to your system java directory (the one containing bin, ext, jre, lib, etc.).  On my system, that was: <pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate" title="">cd processing
rm -rf java
ln -s /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-1.6.0.15﻿ java
</pre></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In processing/libraries/opengl/library remove the 3 libjogl*.so files and libgluegen-rt.so. Symlink their replacements from /usr/lib/jni with for example: <pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate" title="">cd processing/libraries/opengl/library
rm lib*.so
ln -s /usr/lib/jni/libgluegen-rt.so
ln -s /usr/lib/jni/libjogl_awt.so
ln -s /usr/lib/jni/libjogl.so
</pre></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://users.design.ucla.edu/~acolubri/processing/gsvideo/home/" title="GSVideo website">Download</a> and unpack gsvideo into processing/libraries.  You should be able to run the examples in processing/libraries/gsvideo/examples/Capture with the PDE (Processing Development Environment).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://nyatla.jp/nyartoolkit/wiki/index.php?NyAR4psg.en" title="NyARToolkit for Processing website">Download</a> and unpack the NyARToolkit for Processing library into processing/libraries.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You should now be able to run the NyARToolkit examples by changing replacing the import call as follows:</p>
<pre class="brush: java; title: ; notranslate" title="">// replace this call:
// import processing.video.*;
// by this call:
import codeanticode.gsvideo.*;
</pre>
<p>and changing the Capture class (twice) to GSCapture and perhaps also the capture resolution, depending on your camera. The relevant conversions are:</p>
<pre class="brush: java; title: ; notranslate" title="">// Capture cam;
// becomes:
GSCapture cam;

// later, in setup():
// cam=new Capture(this,width,height);
// becomes:
cam=new GSCapture(this,width,height);
</pre>
<p>The major trick in all of this is converting your Processing installation to use your system 64bit JDK instead of its own built-in 32bit JDK.</p>
<p>Let me know in the comments if this worked (or didn’t) for you!</p>
