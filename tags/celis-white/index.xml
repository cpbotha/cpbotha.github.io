<p>In this, the 179th edition of the WHV, I look back at the week from Monday,
September 24 to Sunday, September 29, 2019.</p>
<p>We spent slightly more than half of this time on vacation in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cederberg">Cederberg
mountains</a>.</p>
<p>This Cederberg mountains frame and support a truly beautiful place, with as
one of its many additional features the fact that mobile phone reception and
other forms of modern digital communication have not managed to penetrate all
that much.</p>
<p>(Because this time was spent for the largest part, as it should be, in direct
experience mode, that is, &ldquo;humans see, humans taste, humans run, the end&rdquo;, the
rest of this post contains many images and has morphed into a sort of holiday
report.)</p>
<p>To be more specific about the how and the where, we hitched a super compact
version of one of those self-contained
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_%26_Conquer_(1995_video_game)">Command-&amp;-Conquer</a>-like
mobile bases, in the shape of a <a href="http://www.echo4x4.co.za/product/echo-4-off-road-trailer/">rugged-looking 4x4
trailer</a> (all of
this temporarily arranged), to our decidedly non-4x4 family carrier vehicle,
and set off on a high gradient drive to a tourist farm in the Cederberg called
Driehoek.</p>

wonderfully preserved San rock art:</p>

<p>We also went exploring the Stadsaal caves themselves. This specific scene
reminded me strongly of the composition of a Star Wars poster:</p>

<p>On our way back from the Stadsaal caves, we took a turn-off and went down the
mountain to visit <a href="https://cederbergpark.com/">Cederberg Park</a> on the
Kromrivier farm.</p>
<p>Ostensibly this was about lunch, but the deeper purpose was experiencing the
locally brewed <a href="http://www.nieuwbrew.co.za/">NieuwBrew</a> craft beer.</p>
<p>The hot day seemed to be perfect for a Weiss, and so I chose the Sandfish Weiss:</p>

<p>On this day, in that beautiful location, the Sandfish Weiss scored an 11/10 on
<a href="/2016/08/15/weekly-head-voices-111-a-swift-hack/">the famous WHV Celis White
scale</a>.</p>
<p>After lunch and NieuwBrew, we paid a visit to the <a href="https://www.cederbergwine.com">Cederberg
Wines</a> cellar for a grand old wine-tasting.</p>
<p>Again the visit was that much more special because it&rsquo;s simply not that easy to
reach, but here again the wines surprised with their quality. Our host Aubrey
did a sterling job guiding us on this journey of taste and flavour.</p>
<p>On the way out, I was again pleasantly surprised to run into more <a href="https://www.cederbergbrewery.com/the-team/">craft beer
constructed by the Cederberg Wines winemakers David Niewoudt and Alex
Nel</a>.</p>

<p>WHV score: 11/10, getting worried about how and when I&rsquo;ll be able to acquire
more of this.</p>
<h2 id="humans-run">Humans run.</h2>
<p>On the Friday morning, I did a short run(ish) up the mountain(ish).</p>
<p>The scenery was epic, but the mountain(ish) was steep, and the wine and beer
tasting of the previous days did my legs absolutely zero (0) favours.</p>
<p>Enjoyment 10/10, performance 4/10.</p>
<p>You would have thought that this would be a lesson, but no.</p>
<p>All of the endless gravel roads we took during the rest of the Friday on our
visits to the caves and to the cellar called to me during the night.</p>
<p>On the Saturday morning, I girded up my loins, donned my trusty sandals, and
off I went on my favourite running surface: gravel roads, surrounded by as
much nothingness as possible.</p>

<p>After the first few kilometres, I took a turn-off onto a gravel road that we
had not yet explored, with the idea to add a few more kilometres before turning
back.</p>
<p>However, my keen sense of direction, where with &ldquo;keen sense&rdquo; I mean &ldquo;<em>utter</em>
lack of&rdquo;, convinced me that the road I was on would eventually meet the
turn-off on the very other side of the farm.</p>
<p>So I kept on running.</p>
<p>I did have a cut-off point in mind, where if I did not yet see the expected
entrance, I would have to turn around.</p>
<p>After a few more kilometres of gravel road through beautiful nothing, and a few
more upward adjustments of my turn-around point into over-exertion territory, I
was experiencing an interesting bit of stress.</p>
<p>Based on only a hunch, substantially weakened by my sense of direction track
record, do I turn around, or do I double down for the great reward of an epic
run in the Cederberg?</p>
<p>DO I FEEL LUCKY, PUNK?!</p>
<p>Well, sneaky engineer chose door #3: Acquire More Data.</p>
<p>I flagged down a car.</p>
<p>The friendly driver knew nothing about Driehoek, at which point I started
sinking into the hard ground.</p>
<p>Suddenly he perked up and said that in fact he did remember passing it a few
kilometres back.</p>
<p>Whoohoo!</p>
<p>With the driver thanked and my stress greatly reduced, I switched back into
running mode, now truly committed to close this particular loop.</p>
<p>After a few kilometres more, I finally arrived at the revered entrance.</p>
<p>My legs were feeling quite empty (thanks more beer and wine the previous day!),
but there was still a little more enjoyment to be squeezed from the remaining
kilometre or four of winding gravel road back to our camp, and so I did my
best.</p>
<p>The run itself was a whole lot easier than writing a satisfying ending to this
piece of text, a task that has me convincingly stumped.</p>
<p>P.S. I&rsquo;m keeping this post here. It&rsquo;ll be fun to read in a few years.</p>

<p>Shortly after returning from NL, my year counter ticked over one more time.</p>
<p>I have become indeed <em>quite</em> middle-aged.</p>
<p>On the flip side, I am content with where I find myself in space-time, both physically and meta-physically. Although I seem to think more slowly, I do seem to have become slightly better at retrospection, introspection and at <a href="/2016/05/22/weekly-head-voices-107-balance/">seeing the bigger picture</a>.</p>
<p>As an additional consolation, it seems that I am in the best physical condition I have been for years due to a recent(ish) and surprising discovery of a latent jogging addiction. I am terrible at the action itself, but I really enjoy being repeatedly terrible at it.</p>
<p>On the topic of consolation, I tasted (at least) three new local craft beers, the experience of which I would like to share with you.</p>

<p>The Striped Horse Pils won gold at the 2015 and <a href="http://brewmistress.co.za/winners-of-the-2016-south-african-national-beer-trophy/">2016 National Beer Trophy</a>. More importantly, it also won the WHV-two-voices-cheering-loudly award, because it’s a full-bodied hoppy beer.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jackblackbeer.com/#atlantic-weiss">Jack Black Atlantic Weiss</a> gets a whopping 9.8 on <a href="/2016/08/15/weekly-head-voices-111-a-swift-hack/">my famous Celis White scale</a>. This is the lighter, fresher version of the Bone Crusher that we’ve all been waiting for. Now you just have to cross your fingers that more suppliers will get this. At this moment, it’s still quite tricky to track down.</p>
<p>On a subsequent failed mission to acquire more Atlantic Weiss, I ran into the Newlands Spring Brewing Company’s <em>Mountain Weiss</em>. As I was enjoying this light white beer (THE SUMMER IS COMING) something was tugging at the edge of my memory…</p>
<p>As I turned the bottle around, my worst suspicions were confirmed: Newlands Spring Brewing Company belongs to South African Breweries (SAB), the behemoth beer-brewing international mega-corp. They’ve been trying to get into the craft beer market, a sector traditionally belonging to often entrepreneurial and even family-run small enterprises, and this was their sneaky attempt.</p>
<p>In spite of its lovely taste, I do prefer spending my craft beer budget on mom-and-pop setups. Besides the truly tasty beer, I really like that craft beer has democratised a traditionally closed (by SAB!) area of commerce, and so would prefer putting my money there.</p>
<p>(That is not to say that I don’t buy SAB’s non-craft beers. A man gets thirsty!)</p>
<p>The following marvelous animation <a href="https://twitter.com/WorldAndScience/status/795747812424216576">popped up in my twitter timeline</a>:</p>

<p>Someone configured their camera stabilisation to lock on to the milky way in this National Geographic timelapse video. The result of this simple experiment is that you can clearly see the rotation of the Earth.</p>
<p>It’s really amazing what you can achieve by simply changing your perspective.</p>
<p>In Other Much More Important News, one of my last academic children <a href="http://noeskasmit.com/defended-phd-thesis-virtual-surgical-pelvis-anatomy-visualization-education-surgical-planning/">got doctorified on October 31</a>. I left academia for entirely non-children-related reasons (the children were the best part of academia!) <a href="http://noeskasmit.com/my-phd-supervisor-left-me/">shortly after she started with her doctorate</a>, hence the significance of this.</p>
<p>Henceforth, everyone has to add an extra DOCTOR to her already impressive title, namely <a href="https://twitter.com/eagereyes/status/793107701400162305">Evil Empress of the SciVis Galaxy</a>. Doctor Evil Empress of the SciVis Galaxy will continue her reign from her new (iron?) throne in the Visualization Group at the University of Bergen, Norway.</p>
<p>Don’t worry puny subjects, you are in good hands!</p>
<p>I read somewhere that good stories tend to make circles (could anyone help me out with a good reference?), so let me end this thing with a brilliantly coloured but slightly more lonesome sunset:</p>

In this here,the one hundred and eleventh edition of the Weekly Head Voices, I present a personal view of selected events that took place in the time between Monday, July 25 and Sunday, August 14 of 2016.</p>
<p>Post summary: HackerNews FastMail to Gmail retrospective (WARNING NERD CONTENT), Craft Beer tips, Swift Playgrounds (teach your kids to code!) and a tiny bit of backyard philosophy at the end.</p>
<h2 id="the-hackernews-effect">The HackerNews effect</h2>
<p>When I submitted my <a href="/2016/08/06/moving-12-years-of-email-from-gmail-to-fastmail/">Moving 12 years of email from GMail to Fastmail blog post</a> to HackerNews last Monday, it was after some consideration, and with considerable trepidation. The previous time a similar post of mine was picked up by the HN frontpage (and reddit) in 2013, it resulted in a great number of fairly harsh insults flung my way (the harsh ones seem to hit much harder than the many more constructive ones can compensate for). The problem is not having your work criticised, it’s rather being ad hominem’ed into the ground.</p>
<p>The internet can unfortunately get quite bad that way.</p>
<p>However, this time the internet was in a good mood!</p>
<p>As a Z-list (aka hobbyist) blogger, I already get quite excited when even two people find something entertaining or educational in my blog, so you can imagine my excitement when I saw my blog stats jump into the thousands during the first hour after hitting the HN front page.</p>
<p>646 upvotes, 365 comments (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12247401">in the HN discussion</a>) and more than 50 thousand blog post views later (!!), my asbestos suit is still in storage, and the box of kleenex (for drying up my tears) is still unopened. I am very happy with the healthy and mostly happy discussion both on HN and here on the blog.</p>
<h2 id="a-taste-of-my-secret-beer-notes">A taste of my secret beer notes</h2>
<p>In my travels around the world (ok, maybe just in a few hundred kilometre radius of where I live) I taste many exotic and strange drinks (okay, maybe just the local craft beers). Here’s an excerpt from my top secret beer notes for your reading and hopefully soon tasting pleasure:








<figure><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/stellies_bosch_weiss.jpg">
    <img
        
            
            src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/stellies_bosch_weiss-648x1024.jpg"

            <p>Stellies Bosch Weiss</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>
</p>
<p>The <strong>Stellies Bosch Weiss</strong> is is a refreshing white beer which I can imagine enjoying much more in 35 celsius. However, I find it way too gassy for my taste and thus give it 0.4 on the Celis White scale. As everyone knows, <a href="https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/565/5222/">Celis White</a> is the best white beer in the world. I’m also not the biggest fan of CBC’s Krystal Weiss because of its gassiness. This could also be a German vs Belgian thing.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.darlingbrew.co.za/beers.html#/bc">Darling Brew Bone Crusher</a> is probably a 0.8 on the Celis scale, and scores mega bonus points for choosing such a heavy metal name.

</p>
<p>Citizen Beer has a real knack for naming beers; so this weekend I was able to do my patriotic duty (ha ha) by enjoying their <strong>Patriot lager</strong>. Fortunately, they also have a great knack for making lovely beers. This lager is more than hoppy enough to remind you that it’s a craft, but at the same time it is refreshingly light.







<figure><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/devils_peak_lager.jpg">
    <img

</figure>
</p>
<p>Not completely coincidentally, I also tasted the <strong>Devil’s Peak Lager</strong> this weekend. There are subtle differences between it and the Patriot which I will only be able to describe after more tasting. For now: Same lightness, but with enough hop. Highly enjoyable.

</p>
<p>As I’ve mentioned before, it’s no coincidence that happiness and hoppiness look so similar. The <strong>Devil’s Peak Pale Ale</strong> was a superbly hoppy (about 239% more hoppy than the lager) and full flavoured conclusion to the weekend. In spite of its full body this Cape Town beer’s alcohol content is lower than I would have expected: Only 4%.</p>
<h2 id="first-impressions-of-swift-playgrounds">First impressions of Swift Playgrounds</h2>
<p>I might or might not have acquired a new iPad Air 2 with the primary motivation of being able to test the new <a href="https://www.apple.com/swift/playgrounds/">Swift Playgrounds</a> on Genetic Offspring Unit #1 (now 10 years old). This is a new and attractive iPad-only app that has been designed by Apple to teach kids how to program in Swift. Note that you’ll have to upgrade to <a href="https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/">iOS 10 Beta</a> to get the app, at least until <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/ios10-preview/">iOS 10 is officially released</a>. One of the exercises looks like this (image taken from the website):</p>

        /> </a>

<p>Previous experiments with <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">scratch</a> and with <a href="https://processing.org/">processing</a> have met with limited success but no permanence. However, GOU#1 is an iPad fanatic, and the potential of getting her addicted to the programming bug is just too fantastic to let this opportunity go by.</p>
<p>On the first day, she was already writing functions and for loops in Swift in order to navigate a cute alien solving puzzles on a 3D landscape.  I was looking over her shoulder now and then: The educational content and execution of the app is impressive. Besides the built-in puzzle worlds such as the 3D one pictures above, you can create your own Swift projects from scratch. These projects can use iPad hardware such as bluetooth and the camera, but we’re not quite there yet. Apple has also promised to keep on expanding the educational content.</p>
<p>I’m really crossing my fingers that GOU#1 will keep at it. If Swift Playgrounds helps to get her programming, I might just have to go full fanboy.</p>
<h2 id="heading">∞♥</h2>
<p>This past Friday at the breakfast table, Genetic Offspring Unit #2 asked her mom how much she thought GOU#2 loved the baby GOU#3, upon which the mom asked “How much do you love GOU#3?”.</p>
<p>GOU#2 answered: Infinitely much!</p>
<p>My fragile parental unit heart almost exploded with happiness at this point. It’s what I tell GOU#1 and #2 when I put them to bed, and every morning when I drop them at school. (GOU#3 herself does not yet parse our language.)</p>
<p>Ok kids, it looks like there’s an infinite amount of the good stuff to go around. You know what to do!
