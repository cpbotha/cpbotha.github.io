posts titled &ldquo;Moving M years of K from Y to Z&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As can be seen in the <a href="/about/history/">history page</a> or rather the <a href="/2001/02/27/1469/">first
weblog entry dated 2001-02-27</a>, this blog has been around
for more than 18 years.</p>
<p>It started as some CGI script, then spent some time as a LiveJournal, then,
thanks to meeting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriella_Coleman">Professor Biella
Coleman</a> who was at that
point still a grad student, went through a Movable Type phase and then, at
some point, converted to Wordpress.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know when exactly the Wordpress stage started, but it&rsquo;s probably not
too long after Wordpress was born in 2003 somewhere.</p>
<p>Anyways, after many happy years together, our ways are parting.</p>
<p>The new block-based editor in Wordpress 5, <a href="/tags/gutenberg/">Gutenberg</a>,
caters more for Wordpress as a CMS, and far less for Wordpress as a platform
for long-form blogging.</p>
<p>Personally I have noticed that the new editor gets in my way most of the time,
where the pre-Gutenberg editor worked just perfectly, for my use case.</p>
<p>Because life is short, and many more blog posts have to written, I made the
decision, not easily, to move this blog away from Wordpress, to a different
and hopefully more suitable platform.</p>
<p>I ended up choosing Hugo because its native mode of operation involves me
writing posts in some form of text editor, which is my preferred modality in
any case, but primarily because of all the static generators, it was the only
one with a prominent <a href="https://ox-hugo.scripter.co">Emacs Orgmode plugin</a>.</p>
<p>(Based on what I now know about Hugo, it looks like once again Emacs Orgmode
helped me make the best decision.)</p>
<p>In the rest of this post I describe the process of migrating the blog you see
before you from Wordpress to Hugo.</p>
<h2 id="export-data-from-wordpress">Export data from Wordpress.</h2>
<p>I used <a href="https://github.com/SchumacherFM/wordpress-to-hugo-exporter">SchumacherFM&rsquo;s
wordpress-to-hugo-exporter</a>
to export my whole wordpress site to a Hugo-compatible project.</p>
<p>Following(ish) <a href="https://github.com/SchumacherFM/wordpress-to-hugo-exporter#usage-with-a-self-hosted-wordpress-installation">the
instructions</a>,
I git cloned the <code>wordpress-to-hugo-exporter</code> into the <code>wp-content/plugins</code>
folder of the relevant wordpress installation, and then I invoked the export
script with <code>php hugo-export-cli.php</code>.</p>
<p>The end-result was a 600MB <code>/tmp/wp-hugo.zip</code> which I SCP&rsquo;d down to my laptop
and then unzipped into a directory called <code>hugo-export</code>.</p>
<h2 id="install-hugo-get-site-up-and-running">Install hugo get site up and running.</h2>
<p>The main goal here was to get Hugo running with the exported wordpress data.</p>
<p>After installing hugo with <code>brew install hugo</code>, I continued with Hugo&rsquo;s <a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/">quick
start instructions</a>.</p>
<p>Create the new Hugo site:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>hugo new site cpbotha.net
</code></pre><p>Copy the exported contents into the Hugo site:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>mv hugo-export/* cpbotha.net/content/
</code></pre><p>I chose <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-minos/">the minos theme</a> from the
great <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io">Hugo Themes repository</a> and installed it into
the new site like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>cd cpbotha.net/themes
git clone https://github.com/carsonip/hugo-theme-minos.git
</code></pre><p>Before starting up the new site for the first time, I edited the top-level
<code>config.toml</code> so it looked like the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#f7f7f7;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-toml" data-lang="toml"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#1f2328">baseURL</span> <span style="color:#1f2328">=</span> <span style="color:#0a3069">&#34;https://cpbotha.net/&#34;</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Note: The theme that you currently see on this site is a modified version of
minos, implemented using Hugo&rsquo;s <a href="https://gohugo.io/themes/theme-components/">Theme
Components</a> mechanism.</p>
<h3 id="fire-up-hugo-in-development-mode">Fire up Hugo in development mode!</h3>
<p>To see your site in all of its new static glory, you can start Hugo in
development mode from the project&rsquo;s top-level directory:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>cd cpbotha.net/
hugo serve -D
</code></pre><p>By pointing your browser at <code>http://localhost:1313</code>, you&rsquo;ll be able to see a
dynamic version of your site that automatically refreshes whenever you make
changes to any of the underlying files.</p>
<h2 id="transfer-comments-to-disqus">Transfer comments to Disqus.</h2>
<p>This blog&rsquo;s small but amazing group of commenters, and the comments they have
written over the years, are super valuable to me. It was important to transfer
them and their work over to the new blog without a hitch.</p>
<h3 id="motivation">Motivation.</h3>
<p>I considered self-hosting comments using something like
<a href="https://github.com/adtac/commento">Commento</a>, but the fact that I was able to
get ad-free Disqus for free, as this site does not do advertising, and the
fact that the conversion from Wordpress to Disqus is well-documented, won me
over.</p>
<p>Furthermore, going from Wordpress to Commento often involves a quick stop at
Disqus in any case. In other words, the option of self-hosting remains.</p>
<h3 id="procedure">Procedure.</h3>
<p>The Disqus plugin for Wordpress has an automatic &ldquo;import comments&rdquo; mode which
promises to transfer all of your wordpress comments to Disqus.</p>
<p>In my case, this worked for most posts, except those with more than 60 or 70
comments, in thich no comments were transferred.</p>
<p>I ended up following the &ldquo;manual import&rdquo; procedure <a href="https://help.disqus.com/import-export-and-syncing/importing-comments-from-wordpress">documented in the Disqus
help</a>.</p>
<p>In short, you export your whole wordpress site as XML / WXR, download the
file, and then import that using the upload functionality of <a href="https://import.disqus.com/">the Disqus
import site</a>.</p>
<p>This seemed to have transferred all of my comments.</p>
<p>In spite of multiple attempts at automatic import, followed by the manual
import, Disqus was clever enough not to duplicate any comments.</p>
<h4 id="export-domain-name-should-be-same-as-display-domain-name">Export domain name should be same as display domain name.</h4>
<p>It is important when you export your Wordpress comments, that the domain-name
you export from is the same as the domain-name where you&rsquo;ll end up displaying
the Disqus comments.</p>
<p>If this is not the case, you will have to edit the exported XML files to
search and replaced all of the instances of export domain name to display
domain name.</p>
<h2 id="build-and-upload-the-new-static-hotness">Build and upload the new static hotness.</h2>
<p>My workflow now looks like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write new post in Emacs with <code>hugo serve -D</code> running. The browser window
adjacent to Emacs updates in real-time showing my changes. (I will eventually look into
<a href="https://ox-hugo.scripter.co">ox-hugo</a> so I can write posts in orgmode.)</li>
<li>When I&rsquo;m happy with the post, I build the site with <code>hugo -d ~/Downloads/cpbotha.net</code>
and sync it up to my web host using <code>rsync</code></li>
</ol>
<p>You can build the site by just invoking <code>hugo</code> in the top-level directory, in
which case the output of the build will end up in a sub-directory named
<code>public</code>.</p>
<p>However, I keep the source to this blog in a git repository in my Dropbox, and
I would prefer not syncing the expendable 600MB+ output directory, instead
building it and syncing it from <code>~/Downloads</code>.</p>
<p>The little bash script I used to perform step 2 in one go looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#f7f7f7;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#57606a">#!/bin/bash
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>hugo -d ~/Downloads/cpbotha.net
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#57606a"># sync contents of public dir into static_cpbothanet/</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>rsync -av --progress ~/Downloads/cpbotha.net/ <span style="color:#0a3069">\
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>cpbotha@my.webhost.com:~/webapps/static_cpbothanet
</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="bonus-level-bundling-and-automatic-resizing-of-images">Bonus level: Bundling and automatic resizing of images.</h2>
<p>As each edition of <a href="categories/weekly-head-voices/">the WHV</a> usually contains
at least an image or two, an important piece of the puzzle was how to keep
images together with the markdown post source, instead of in a separate static
directory.</p>
<p>In addition, Wordpress has this great feature where it automatically resizes
images on upload, enabling posts to inline lower resolution versions that can
be clicked on to see the full resolution.</p>
<p>I had resigned myself to the reality that this would probably be a manual
process for Hugo.</p>
<p>Thanks to a <a href="https://laurakalbag.com/processing-responsive-images-with-hugo/">super useful and detailed post by Laura
Kalbag</a>, I
learned that the image-bundling problem had already been addressed by Hugo,
and that Laura Kalbag had developed a Hugo shortcode which solved the second
problem using Hugo&rsquo;s built-in image processing and a relatively new browser
feature called <a href="https://ericportis.com/posts/2014/srcset-sizes/">srcsets</a>.</p>
<p>With her <code>img</code> shortcode, high-resolution images are automatically resized
into multiple lower resolution versions at build time, all of which will be
offered to the client, which will then decide which to download based on the
client-side display parameters.</p>
<p>With regard to the image bundling, this is simply a matter of creating a
directory containing the relevant images and the post contents in a file
called <code>index.md</code>.</p>
<p>In my case, I would create a post by invoking the following command in the
top-level directory:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#f7f7f7;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span style="display:flex;"><span>hugo new content/posts/2019/some-post-slug/index.md
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Based on the <code>permalinks</code> setting in the <code>config.toml</code>, this post will be
available at <code>/year/month/day/slug-in-frontmatter/</code>. The <code>index.md</code> can refer
to images that are in the same directory using just their relative filenames.</p>
<h2 id="mailing-lists">Mailing lists.</h2>
<p>In addition to The Commenters mentioned above, I also treasure The Readers. :)</p>
<p>On the Wordpress blog, I had already started making use of
<a href="https://mailchimp.com/">Mailchimp</a> a while back for the daily and the weekly
post emails, in addition to Wordpress.com&rsquo;s own email subscription which
services the largest group of readers.</p>
<p>I briefly looked into <a href="https://tinyletter.com/">tinyletter</a>, but then decided
that it made the most sense to migrate the Wordpress.com email subscribers
over to the Mailchimp daily email list.</p>
<p>It was relatively straight-forward to export a CSV with subscriber address
from Wordpress.com and then to import that into the Mailchimp list.</p>
<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up.</h2>
<p>Converting this blog from Wordpress to Hugo went significantly more smoothly
than I expected. In fact, the first Hugo version was online after a single
evening of work.</p>
<p>Other than that, Hugo has already impressed me a number of times with its
speed, and features that have clearly been thought through. Besides the
built-in image processing and the theme composition, there are smaller but
still super useful features such as <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/archetypes/">the
archetypes</a> which I have
configured to help me start a blog post more easily.</p>
<p>Let me know in the comments if you have any other questions.</p>

<h2 id="blogosphere-housekeeping">Blogosphere housekeeping.</h2>
<p>In my eternal quest to avoid the new Gutenberg editor in WordPress (now at version 5.1.1), this and the previous post were typed up in Orgmode, and then copy-pasted from the Emacs-exported HTML.</p>
<h2 id="on-being-powerless">On being powerless.</h2>
<p>Years of corruption, in most cases made possible by the current ruling party, the ANC, have left our electricity-producing monoply, Eskom, in shambles.</p>
<p>Billions of rands disappeared into the pockets of dishonest types, instead of being invested into the maintenance and upgrades of our power generation and distribution network.</p>
<p>The result of all of this, is that the country currently has to deal with stage 4 load shedding, which means that electricity is completely shut off for 2.5 hours, three times a day.</p>
<p>This has to be done in order to prevent a total grid shutdown, which would result in a two to three week national electricity outage whilst the grid has to be started back up again.</p>
<p>You can read more about the details in <a href="https://www.businessinsider.co.za/6-quick-fixes-that-can-save-south-africa-from-more-load-shedding-2019-3">this Business Insider article</a>.</p>
<p>Anyways, although there are many worse problems than this in the world today, these 7.5 powerless hours every day are a fairly visceral reminder of the utterly disappointing lack of integrity and leadership in our government.</p>
<p>At a more microscopic level, I am again spending far more time than usual on twitter, as this is where news about the electricity crisis plays out first.</p>
<p>Unfortunately Twitter, or <em>Road Rage of the Internet</em> as it has been called, does not contribute positively to one’s karma, which is the exact opposite of what is required here.</p>
<p>On the bright(ish) side, it does seem as if the whole drama is being adequately documented and analysed in the media.</p>
<p>Although there are fundamental issues at Eskom that need to be addressed, such as the fact that a state-owned entity has the monopoly over electricity production, I am optimistic that there are enough capable folks at Eskom, <em>with</em> spines, to band-aid the system back into operation.</p>
<p>I am less optimistic but still hopeful that this will result in deeper rectifications to both our power production strategy and, more acutely, the South African government.</p>

<p>GOU #1 left us for a week-long, zero-communication canoeing trip, along with about 60 of her fellow pupils, down the Orange River.</p>
<p>Although quite a challenge for our parental hearts, we did expect that this would be quite a valuable adventure for a 12 year old.</p>
<p>We were not wrong, but it sounds as if above-mentioned teenager experienced the adventure more like a week-long party with canoeing breaks thrown in for good measure.</p>
<p>While she was away, the rest of us spent the week on the East coast, in a beautiful coastal village called Morgan Bay.</p>
<p>To be more specific, we stayed at the Morgan Bay Hotel, a brilliant little family-run hotel at the core of the village.</p>
<p>The view from our room was not too shabby. In fact, it looked a little bit like this:

<p>… and sometimes the World’s Worst Trail Runner (me), took on trails, in wet sandals, which were perhaps a tad too technical. See the following beaut for example:

<p>Under immense beer peer pressure, and in the presence of locally brewed craft beer on tap, I finally broke my 2.5 month long alcohol fast with an Emerald Vale Amber Ale.</p>
<p>The beer was tasty, and the moment was suitably bittersweet.

<p>I was happy to find after 10 weeks of zero alcohol that I could drink craft beer like a normal person, without any acclimatisation or noticeable ill effects.</p>
<p>However, thanks to consistently great sleep and subjectively more overall acuity, I will probably continue with zero (or very little) alcohol for a while longer.</p>

<p>I am happy that we ended up with family in Betty’s Bay this weekend.</p>
<p>The recent fires have stripped away so much vegetation that I was easily able to reach a spot I had never been able to navigate to before.</p>
<p>I made a panorama in which you can hopefully appreciate some of the devastation caused by the blaze:

<p>Welcome to the first WHV of the year 2019 folks!</p>
<p>In what is hopefully just a minor incident and not a portent of calamitous events to come, we have already skipped the first two weeks of the year, which means this WHV looks back at the three weeks from Monday January 7 to Saturday January 26.</p>
<p>I guess this would not be the WHV if we did not start off with some sort of awkwardness or miscellaneous embarrassment, so: CHECK!</p>
<p>Because you are probably thirsty for your WHV now, I tried to write you a long and rambly edition, with pictures! (Because it’s so long and rambly, and because markdown, I have liberally sprinkled with headings and sub-headings, so that those of you with lives outside of blog reading can hop, skip and jump through like the professionals you are.)</p>
<h2 id="the-future-is-here-long-form-blog-posts-on-the-ipad">The future is here: Long-form blog posts on the iPad.</h2>
<p>This also would not be the WHV if we did not have some little digital trick to reveal: Today’s attempt is that this post is being written, for the largest part, on a 2018 iPad (the cheapest one) with an old (also very cheap) bluetooth keyboard.</p>
<p>Because I really don’t like the new block-based WordPress 5.0 editor, named in an entirely non-hubristic fashion “Gutenberg”, but it does fortunately support importing markdown formatted blog posts (just make sure you don’t hard-wrap anything), and because I like trying new things, I am typing this on the iPad using the iOS version of <a href="https://www.textasticapp.com/">Textastic</a>.</p>
<p>A few hours ago, it looked like this:










<figure><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/img_0005.png">

        /> </a>

</p>
<p>In contrast to the direct <a href="https://vxlabs.com/2014/05/25/emacs-24-with-prelude-org2blog-and-wordpress/">orgmode to wordpress Emacs workflow</a> I normally use, this workflow enables me to copy and paste sections of markdown text into WordPress. Each pasted section is automatically imported as WordPress blocks, based on the markdown structure.</p>
<p>This means I can position and edit images using the WordPress interface, but author the text using Markdown. With <a href="https://github.com/org2blog/org2blog">org2blog</a> the whole post, including images, has to go through life as an orgmode file, which is brilliant for my more technical posts, but not so much for prose-heavy blog posts such as this one.</p>
<h3 id="btw-1-why-i-dont-yet-like-the-new-wordpress-editor">BTW 1: Why I don’t (yet) like the new WordPress editor.</h3>
<p>The old WordPress editor enabled me to focus on the content and just write.</p>
<p>The new <a href="https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/">Gutenberg editor</a> now wants me to create a bunch of blocks, e.g. paragraph, image, paragraph, bullet list, etc., and then work with those blocks.</p>
<p>That’s really great if you’re building a site, but not so much when you would just like to get down and write that blog post.</p>
<p>Although this is now the standard editor in WordPress, there are still bugs, such as the fact that my cursor keeps on jumping to the start of the block while I’m typing, which is not irritating at all, and the not unimportant observation that none of the mobile apps support Gutenberg yet.</p>
<p>WordPress-using readers, what do you think?</p>
<p>(P.S. Another just-discovered issue: In Gutenberg, your biggest heading is H2. H1 is not available in the UI normally. When pasting in markdown, H1s do display, but do not show in the type-UI as anything. Here is <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/4234">a confusing Gutenberg bug report</a>.)</p>
<h3 id="btw-2-why-textastic-aka-at-least-it-will-syntax-highlight-your-orgmode">BTW 2: Why Textastic? (AKA At least it will syntax highlight your Orgmode.)</h3>
<p>The main reason I found and purchased Textastic, was that I ran into <a href="https://github.com/jezcope/Org.tmbundle">Jez Cope’s github repo</a> with a TextMate Bundle (that’s an editor configuration) that was made for Textastic to support editing Emacs orgmode files.</p>
<p>As is the age-old open source way, there were a few small bugs which I <a href="https://github.com/jezcope/Org.tmbundle/pull/5">fixed in my fork</a>, which you should definitely get if you are in the same I-want-to-edit-Orgmode-on-my-iOS boat as I am. It’s not a very large boat, but it’s super fun!</p>
<p>(There is no Emacs on iOS. This is in my view the greatest downside of iOS. It turns out that Apple generally does not allow apps with embedded interpreters on the app store. However, I am still trying to find out why there are no iOS-capable Emacs source code forks available.)</p>
<h3 id="btw-3-the-ipad-with-keyboard-is-a-shockingly-good-laptop-replacement">BTW 3: The iPad with keyboard is a shockingly good laptop replacement.</h3>
<p>I recently recommended to a privacy-conscious reader who was searching for an affordable Linux-running laptop in South Africa, that she instead consider buying an iPad with bluetooth keyboard.</p>
<p>Down here a brand new 2018 iPad costs R5999. A cheap keyboard cover (e.g. Body Glove) can be had for about R860.</p>
<p>If you compare this to any new laptop of R6900 (about EUR 444) which will probably be sold with Windows included, you get a computing device with a fantastic quality multi-touch screen, great battery life, best-in-class security, almost no maintenance, and a fantastic app ecosystem. To seal the deal, the iPad’s resale value is proportionally probably also much better than that entry-level laptop.</p>
<p><em>After</em> I sent that email, I started with this iPad + cheap bluetooth keyboard experiment to try it for myself. I have to say that the experience has been way better than I expected.</p>
<p>For a large subset of laptop users, and for a large subset of workflows and tasks, this is a really great solution.</p>
<p>Please don’t worry (too much) yet, I am not planning one of those “I switched to an iPad as my main computing device” blog posts. I would not be able to survive without my development tools, and I would especially not be able to survive without my Emacs.</p>
<h2 id="pv-solar-installation-progress">PV Solar installation progress</h2>
<p>As I excitedly <a href="/2018/12/19/weekly-head-voices-159-extreme/#extreme-solar">announced in WHV #159</a> (slightly more than a month ago), we had decided that it was time to get a photovoltaic solar power system installed at the house.</p>
<p>I found a local installer with the required PVGreenCard accreditation and started the consultation process.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the installer did not seem to be prepared for a customer that would not stop asking questions. The customer even went so far as to pose questions that challenged the installer’s brand loyalty!</p>
<p>I really do understand that I’m probably not the easiest end-user, but I don’t think that an expert’s brand loyalty should get in the way of reason, and far more importantly in the way of basic physics.</p>
<p>To make a long story short, I ended up getting fired by the installer.</p>
<p>This was probably for the better: He can now continue doing well-practised installs for other clients who don’t ask (so many) questions, and I suddenly had the opportunity to find a new, more engineer-friendly installer, and to continue learning.</p>
<p>Following are two noteworthy learnings:</p>
<h3 id="learning-1-you-should-almost-always-try-to-oversize-the-photovoltaic-array">Learning 1: You should almost always try to oversize the photovoltaic array</h3>
<p>If the equipment states for example 4600kVA, then you are usually quite safe installing from 25% up to 30% more kWp of solar panels.</p>
<p>Oversizing will mean that on very sunny days you’ll get peaks higher than the maximum rated PV, which can be handled for short periods by the solar equipment, but more importantly, you’ll be able to generate more electricity when there is less sun, which is most of the time.</p>
<p>In other words, you increase the area under the curve of kW generated per hour.</p>
<p>By the way, I emailed GoodWe (they make the hybrid inverters I have my eye on) who confirmed that their EM range supports 27.8% oversizing. The ES range advertise 30% PV oversizing on the box.</p>
<p>It is of course an interesting question what exactly is meant by oversizing. Do they support pumping 30% more power into the inverter for 5 minutes, or for 2 hours?</p>
<h3 id="learning-2-powerforumcoza-is-a-great-source-of-information">Learning 2: powerforum.co.za is a great source of information.</h3>
<p><a href="https://powerforum.co.za/">This forum</a> has a surprisingly high signal to noise ratio.</p>
<p>There are a number of experts hanging around, including one of Victron’s super helpful and knowledgeable R&amp;D engineers, and the archive posts are invaluable as you try to navigate <a href="https://powerforum.co.za/topic/2791-experience-getting-city-of-cape-town-to-sign-off-a-zero-feed-in-system-with-inverter-maximum-output-greater-than-35kva/">the quagmire</a> of often conflicting information.</p>
<h2 id="avocado-baby-progress-very-much-touch-and-go">Avocado baby progress: Very much touch and go.</h2>
<p>The baby avocado tree, in spite of being being watered almost every day (thank you rainwater harvest!) does not seem to be doing too well.</p>
<p>Because the summer sun down here can be quite vicious, the tree has its own little pink umbrella.</p>
<p>The current plan is to feed it more compost, and, if that fails, to try to transplant it out of the big, wild garden and into a pot with softer, kinder earth.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-explain-complicated-topics">How to explain complicated topics</h2>
<p>The international and yearly <a href="https://mlssafrica.com">Machine Learning Summer School took place in Stellenbosch this year</a>, from Monday, January 7 to Friday, January 18.</p>
<p>As you can see from the programme, there were a bunch of heavy hitting speakers present both physically and virtually, including the super resourceful (failed super resolution pun, su(p)e(r) me) Dr Stefan van der Walt, who gave a talk on good scientific software.</p>
<p>Anyways, because I am currently in a more commercial configuration, I could not justify taking two weeks out, and instead opted for a day visit at the start of the congress.</p>
<p>It is a testament to the current prominence of the field that the list of international sponsors included Microsoft, Apple, SAP, Uber <em>and</em> Amazon.</p>
<p>It was gratifying to experience a sampling of such a well-organized international gathering here in my neck of the woods.</p>
<p>On the first day, we had a high throughput introduction to causality, probabilistic thinking, and variational inference. All the presenters were clearly good speakers, but they weren’t all equally experienced in teaching such complex material.</p>
<p>(At one point one of the statisticians I was chatting to in break admitted having difficulty keeping up with the math. I did not feel <strong>that</strong> stupid anymore.)</p>
<p>“What is the difference between being a good speaker and an experienced teacher?”, you might now ask.</p>
<p>Great question, I would then say, grateful for the opportunity to explain.</p>
<p>What I was missing in the one specific case I do not want to be too specific about, was that the presenter did a great job of talking about each of a long list of concepts relevant to his topic, but somehow forgot that one of the most important parts of teaching is communicating the conceptual framework into which all of those concepts fit.</p>
<p>Conceptual frameworks are also one of those multi-scalar things: Each group of factoids can be gratifyingly embedded into a slightly higher level component, groups of which can be slotted into the overarching “big idea”, or another level of compnonent. (It’s turtles all the way down.)</p>
<p>As great lecturers talk, they keep on bringing their narrative back up to the higher-level embedding construct.</p>
<p>It looks something like this:










<figure><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/teach_complicated_things.png">
    <img

            <p>Yes, I did make this especially for this post, especially for you. No, I am not sure exactly why.</p>

</p>
<p>By repeatedly diving deeper into the details, and then following the conceptual link back up to the higher-level constructs and especially your big idea, your listeners will start to see the beautiful fractal of understanding that you are guiding them through.</p>
<h2 id="what-will-i-be-working-on-this-year">What will I be working on this year?</h2>
<p>At this moment, 2019 is shaping up to be pretty exciting work-wise.</p>
<p>We just heard that we will be able to continue for some months more working on the X-Ray based surgical planning project we worked on last year.</p>
<p>Partly thanks to the great deep learning work of two summer interns (note: Southern Hemisphere means summer interns over December and January, which might be weird if you’re from the Northern Hemisphere) we are in great shape for all of the deep neural network-based image understanding plans we need to execute on.</p>
<p>This year I will also be spending more time on <a href="https://www.telesensi.com">TeleSensi, our FDA-certified tele-auscultation product</a>. This is less rocket-sciencey than the surgical planning project, but super interesting to work on, as it has many more users on the open market.</p>
<p>(That being said, we do have plans to increase the level of rocket science significantly. I am not called the science officer for nothing… (well, that and also the fact that I got to choose my own title, and so I chose the same as Spock on the USS Enterprise).)</p>
<h2 id="do-you-write-stuff-down">Do you write stuff down?</h2>
<p>You might remember from WHV #155 <a href="https://cpbotha.net/2018/10/12/weekly-head-voices-155-lush/#productivity-pro-tip-fool-yourself-into-doing-a-good-daily-review">my trick of starting the day with a checklist</a>.</p>
<p>A part of that checklist is a checklist of habits which I try to form and maintain, called The HabitFormer(tm). Every item that I sufficiently address gets a super satisfying little <code>[X]</code> mark, which feels a whole lot better than the sadly empty <code>[ ]</code> construct.</p>
<p>Here is the current list:</p>
<ul>
<li>did you write stuff down?</li>
<li>are you satisfied with number of pomodori?</li>
<li>7.5 hrs sleep last night</li>
<li>meditate &lt;– (WHV <em>hidden</em> pro-tip: Get the <a href="https://wakingup.com/">Waking Up</a> app by Sam Harris. Thanks LM for the fantastic recommendation.)</li>
<li>stand at desk</li>
<li>do valuable things</li>
<li>fruit &amp; veg</li>
<li>reading</li>
<li>thinking</li>
<li>running or other exercise</li>
</ul>
<p>Ironically enough, the first item is brand new on the list.</p>
<p>I somehow forgot my habit of writing, during the day, a little done list / random thoughts lists. After bringing this habit back I noticed what difference it made.</p>
<p>At regular intervals during the day, I will spend a minute or three writing down what I had completed, or what I was thinking. This moment of introspection would either result in a pleasant bit of satisfaction with some small task taken care of, or, more often, it would reel me back in from a spot of less than deliberate action and enable me to bring back my attention to the point of focus.</p>
<p>I’m filing this under “101 tricks to get your <a href="https://cpbotha.net/2018/05/20/weekly-head-voices-143-the-rider-and-the-elephant/">rider back on your elephant</a>“.</p>
<p>Alright friends, thank you very much for joining me on this part of my journey. I am looking forward to our next interaction!</p>
