<p>The first Weekly Head Voices of 2020 is almost two months late.</p>
<p>When there&rsquo;s any sort of significant WHV hiatus, you can bet your lucrative
blogging career that there&rsquo;s something important afoot in the life of the
person owning the head that mostly contains the eponymous voices featuring at
the core of this blog&rsquo;s business.</p>
<p>If you prefer that I misuse a pet-related metaphor instead, WHV breaks are
almost like dry noses in dog world.</p>
<p>Indeed, I chose the start of this year to deal with a long-standing health
issue which I had been avoiding and/or postponing for a few years now, thanks
to irrational anxiety. (The irony of this does not escape me.)</p>
<p>I am <em>quite</em> happy to report that, in an utterly unsurprising non-turn of
events, science and modern medicine prevailed. Hard.</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t get the wrong impression.</p>
<p>I am utterly grateful for the predictability, and for the science, and for
modern medicine and its precise practitioners.</p>
<p>As I sit here, my internal sensors report all systems greener than they have
been in quite a while.</p>
<p>At this moment, life is truly brilliant.</p>
<h2 id="gou-1-is-now-a-high-schooler">GOU #1 is now a high-schooler.</h2>
<p>At the end of last year, <a href="/2019/12/08/weekly-head-voices-185-starship-gou-1/#starship-gou-1-taxiing-on-the-runway">I wrote about GOU #1 finishing primary
school</a>.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the pace of development seems to have picked up even more.</p>
<p>GOU #1 is now getting on the bus at Super Early O&rsquo; Clock every morning to go to
her new high school, which sometimes reminds me of a sort of Hogwarts for young
power women.</p>
<p>It feels like she is growing more independent by the day, regularly surprising
us with new skills and capabilities.</p>
<p>Perhaps more importantly, she seems to be handling all of these changes, both
external and internal, with grace and a gratifying helping of reason.</p>
<h2 id="the-whole-cpbothanet-hive-has-been-migrated-to-a-small-hetzner-server">The whole cpbotha.net-hive has been migrated to a small Hetzner server.</h2>
<p>For the past days I&rsquo;ve been quite busy migrating this website, along with a
number of others (<a href="https://vxlabs.com/">vxlabs.com</a>,
<a href="https://medvis.org/">medvis.org</a> and about 10 more), away from WebFaction
(RIP) to a new Hetzner server in Nuremberg.</p>
<p>GoDaddy acquired WebFaction, and they have made clear that they will at some
unknown time in the nearish future pull the plug on the whole WebFaction
setup.</p>
<p>For the 12 years that I was a customer, it was the perfect hoster: The ideal
combination of managed and unmanaged hosting for a very reasonable price.</p>
<p>Although this migration led to quite a bit of work, I am happy that all of the
ported sites are running slightly leaner on the new VPS.</p>
<p>Also, I made use of the opportunity to outfit each ported site with a Let&rsquo;s
Encrypt certificate, meaning we now have 100% SSL.</p>
<p>I would like to note the following possibly helpful learnings:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/duplicator/">Duplicator</a>, a wordpress plugin,
is the perfect solution for transporting a wordpress site from one corner of
the planet to another.</li>
<li>You can use <a href="https://vxlabs.com/2020/02/22/supervisor-fastcgi-nginx/">supervisor to run non-php fastcgi processes behind
nginx</a>.</li>
<li>After the first wordpress migration, I had a checklist in Emacs Orgmode with
which I could migrate the other 7 in my sleep, and almost did. See below for
a Real World Example™.</li>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently reading <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/09/13/760545897/in-something-deeply-hidden-sean-carroll-argues-there-are-infinite-copies-of-you"><em>Something Deeply Hidden: Quantum Worlds and the
Emergence of Spacetime</em> by Sean
Carroll</a>.</p>
<p>Somewhere in there, Carroll mentions the iPhone app <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/universe-splitter/id329233299"><em>Universe
Splitter</em></a>, which
you can use to split the whole universe into copies of itself.</p>
<p>It starts more mundanely, when you have to make a difficult decision between
two options.</p>
<p>Fear no more, because now you can just start up that app, and use quantum
mechanics to make the decision.</p>
<p>As a side effect, you end up splitting the universe.</p>
<p>When you submit your choice, a message is sent to a lab in Switzerland, where a
photon is sent toward a beam splitter.</p>
<p>According to Schrödinger&rsquo;s equation, the splitter turns the photon&rsquo;s wave
function into two components going left <em>and</em> right, each of which ends up at a
different detector.</p>
<p>When either detector picks up the photon, it produces a readout that becomes
entangled with its environment (whoops!), quickly leading to decoherence and a
branching of the wave function into two universes.</p>
<p>Now there are two copies of you.</p>
<p>One copy of you will see choice A, and the other will see choice B.</p>
<h2 id="its-what-future-you-would-want-quote-edition">It&rsquo;s what future you would want, quote edition.</h2>
<p>All the way back in March of &lsquo;19, <a href="/2019/03/09/weekly-head-voices-164-its-what-future-you-would-want/#thinking-of-future-you">I wrote about the suggestion to try to
predict which tasks the completion of which would satisfy future you the most
at the end of the

<p>Well, the other day as I was aimlessly browsing twitter, something which was
decidedly NOT a task that future me would have approved of, or a task anyone
could conceivably ever complete, I came across <a href="https://twitter.com/bitfield/status/1219309618813337601">this jewel tweeted by John
Arundel</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If we are ever in doubt about what to do, it is a good rule to ask ourselves
what we shall wish on the morrow that we had done.  &ndash; John Lubbock</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although the message is the same, I find Lubbock&rsquo;s formulation more elegant.</p>
<p>Folks, have a great week, full of satisfied future yous, in all of the

<p>I was mistakenly under the impression that, at least in my social circles, the
whole vaccination issue had been put completely to rest, but based on the
number of serious questions that I’ve been asked recently, this
unfortunately does not seem to be the case.</p>
<p>For those of you who don’t have time, I’ll cut to the chase immediately:</p>
<p><strong>Yes, you simply <em>must</em> vaccinate your children.  This is the <em>best and
safest</em> choice, for both your child and your fellow humans.</strong></p>
<p><strong>No, there is no link between vaccination and autism. No, spreading out the
(MMR) vaccinations is not safer, it is in fact more dangerous.  Also, the
“vaccine overload” hypothesis is flawed.</strong></p>
<p>For those of you with a bit more time or those of you who are not willing to take me on my word, I’ll go into some more detail on each of the points mentioned above.  Most of what I write here is based on articles in the Wikipedia.  I’ve deliberately done this, because these articles are accessible and readable to everyone, and they do link to the original scientific articles that they are based on.  Feel free to jump to any section.  Also, each section ends with a short summary of its contents to make it easier for you to skip.</p>
<h1 id="recent-history">Recent history</h1>
<p><em>This section is based on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMR_vaccine_controversy" title="Wikipedia article on MMR vaccine controversy">Wikipedia article on the MMR vaccine
controversy</a>.</em></p>
<p>In 1998, Andre Wakefield and co-authors published a paper in the Lancet where,
based on 12 case reports, they speculated on a possible link between the MMR
vaccination and autism, and also speculated that it might be better to space
out the vaccinations.  Of course the press and media picked this up and went
completely wild, causing a health scare in the UK.  It is important to note
that both of these claims were highly speculative.</p>
<p>It later turned out that Wakefield had received 55000 (fifty-five thousand) UK
pounds from Legal Aid Board solicitors who were gathering evidence to use in a
case against vaccine manufacturers, and that a number of parents of the
children taking part in Wakefield’s study were directly involved in the
law-suit.  Wakefield did not mention any of this at the time of publication. 
Ten of his 12 co-authors have since completely retracted their interpretation
of the paper.</p>
<p>In short, the author of the paper that started most of the modern vaccination-autism scare was completely corrupt, and his corruption directly affected this specific research.</p>
<p>He did manage to cause such a scare in the UK, that measles (one of the diseases that MMR vaccinates against) is for the first time in decades at almost epidemic levels.   Since then, there have been cases of measles killing children, something which would most probably not have happened had the vaccination compliance not been at an all-time low.  Isn’t that absolutely crazy when one considers that measles was all but eradicated?</p>
<p>In the years between 1998 and the present, there have been numerous extremely well-designed and large studies, none of which have been able to find <em>any</em> kind of link between vaccination and autism.</p>
<p><em>To summarise this section: The research that the vaccination scare is based
on, was deeply flawed and based on corruption, not science.</em></p>
<h1 id="spreading-out-of-vaccines">Spreading out of vaccines</h1>
<p><em>This section is based on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_controversy#Vaccine_overload" title="Wikipedia article on Vaccine controversy.">Wikipedia article on the general Vaccine
Controversy</a>.</em></p>
<p>In some cases, parents opt for spreading out the vaccinations, because they
mistakenly think that this is safer than not doing so.  The flawed idea that
administering all these vaccines together could be dangerous is called the
“vaccine overload hypothesis”.  It is flawed for the reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Common childhood ilnesses represent a much heavier load on the infant immune system.</li>
<li>The vaccination cocktail given currently represents less than 10% of the immunological load of the vaccinations given to children in the 80s.</li>
<li>Numerous studies have shown that the combination of vaccinations does NOT damage the infant immune system.</li>
</ul>
<p>Importantly, if you spread out vaccines, you increase the time during which your child is susceptible to the diseases that are being vaccinated again, thus greatly increasing the health risk to your child and all other children it comes into contact with.  You are a bad parent if you do this.</p>
<p><em>To summarise this section:</em> <em>Administering the vaccinations together does not damage your child’s immune system.</em> <em>Spreading out vaccines is dangerous for both your child and all children it comes into contact with.</em></p>
<h1 id="celebrities-campaigning-against-vaccination">Celebrities campaigning against vaccination</h1>
<p>Recently, a number of celebrities, most prominent of which Jenny McCarthy and
her partner Jim Carrey, supported by Oprah, have been campaigning against
vaccination.  You have to remember that these are actors and entertainers,
with almost ZERO medical or scientific background or training.   McCarthy
dropped out of nursing school to become a Playboy Bunny: There’s nothing
wrong with that, but you really cannot base important medical decisions,
concerning the health and survival of your child (!!), on the opinions of an
erstwhile nude model!</p>
<p>_To summarise: Think carefully about the scientific and medical backgrounds of
actors telling you how to care for the health and well-being of your child,
even more so when it concerns life and death issues such as vaccination.</p>
<h1 id="the-logical-conclusion">The logical conclusion</h1>
<p>To the best of our scientific knowledge, vaccinations as they are administered today are safe and do not cause autism.  In spite of this, research continues day and night to make sure of this observation.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you don’t vaccinate, the risk of your child
getting ill and dying is <em>significantly</em> higher.  If a large enough number of
you don’t vaccinate, we lose our herd immunity and then there is a very
real risk that <em>many</em> more of our children will get ill and die due to your
inaction.  Do you seriously want to take this very real risk with your <em>and</em>
my children’s lives?</p>
<h1 id="post-scriptum">Post scriptum</h1>
<p>I hope that this has helped.  If there are any issues that are not clear, or
missing, or you are not convinced, please let me know so that we can discuss
and so that I can improve this article.</p>
