An anonymous reader emailed me the following question:
Is it possible to use machine learning or algorithms in a campaign or in an electoral process?
I wrote the following reply:
I don&amp;rsquo;t have any personal experience with this, but I do know that all kinds of algorithms have been and are still used to influence elections, in the US and in the UK, and probably in other countries.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>Guided by the <a href="/2014/06/10/weekly-head-voices-73-keystroke-megaphone/#conserving-keystrokes">&ldquo;keystroke megaphone&rdquo;

<p>An anonymous reader emailed me the following question:</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I wrote the following reply:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any personal experience with this, but I do know that all kinds of
algorithms have been and are still used to influence elections, in the US and
in the UK, and probably in other countries.</p>
<p>If you search online for &ldquo;Cambridge Analytica&rdquo;, you&rsquo;ll find some of the quite
immoral ways in which they used facebook and other social network data to
influence public opinion.</p>
<p>(The Guardian has a great collection called <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/cambridge-analytica-files">The Cambridge Analytica
Files</a>.)</p>
<p>In short: With enough data and some clever &ldquo;big data&rdquo; analytics, it is possible
to determine with quite some precision which groups to target with personalised
advertising campaigns, in order to get whole cities or important states to vote
for your candidate.</p>
<p>Usually this form of analytics is coupled with social media bots, that is to
say, a large number of &ldquo;fake&rdquo; social media accounts that say some or other
thing.</p>
<p>These efforts can be further boosted with purpose-created websites on
legitimate-sounding domains.</p>
<p>The websites and fake accounts strengthen their combined message by citing each
other.</p>
<p>One could go further and even apply psychology to craft these messages very
carefully, so that they have an even higher success rate.</p>
<p>Folks forward these messages in their various forms via communication networks
such as whatsapp (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21134652/whatsapp-2-billion-monthly-active-users-encryption-facebook">2 billion users this
month</a>)
and facebook. The poisoned messages are further strengthened because new
victims receive them from trusted sources, their social connections.</p>
<p>In an even shorter form: <em>The human mind and its social context have been hacked
and are being actively exploited.</em></p>

In it, the author explains how they did an “experiment” demonstrating that topics they discussed verbally were later reflected in Facebook ads.</p>
<p>Whilst it’s prudent to be careful with modern technology around one’s privacy, Vice is being a tad sensationalist. This blog post, which will optimistically be read by three to four people, tries to fill some of the holes they left.</p>
<p>We already know that we can’t trust Facebook in any way, so we are dependent on the telephone’s operating system to take our privacy seriously: That’s usually Android or iOS.</p>
<p>Android does in theory <em>enable</em> background recording up to and including Android O, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2018/3/7/17091104/android-p-prevents-apps-using-mic-camera-idle-background">starting from Android P</a> it will disable this. Unfortunately, it shouldn’t be more than about 10 years before all phones are on Android P or later.</p>
<p>(<a href="/2016/11/27/android-security-in-2016-is-a-mess/">I have previously indicated that I’m not the biggest fan of Android’s security story</a>. I am happy to see that they are making such progress, but the tardiness or even worse refusal of OEMs in upgrading their devices diminishes most of that.)</p>
<p>In iOS on the other hand, there are at least three mechanisms that protect users against this background recording abuse:</p>
<ol>
<li>The app has to ask the user explicitly for microphone permission, which the user can easily revoke at any time (Settings | App’s name | Microphone; see screenshot below for an example).</li>
<li>The developer has to indicate explicitly and statically in their app that they intend to use background audio. Apple’s review process is quite strict and will reject outright an app that does not have a legitimate reason to make use of this function.</li>
<li>Even when an app has been able to convince Apple’s review process that it should be allowed to record audio in the background, there are two more privacy mechanisms in place:
<ol>
<li>An app can only record in the background, if it started to record audio whilst on the foreground. When the recording stops, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/iPhone/Conceptual/iPhoneOSProgrammingGuide/BackgroundExecution/BackgroundExecution.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007072-CH4-SW26">the app will be suspended</a>.</li>
<li>When any app is recording, the system will display a big red bar at the top of the iOS display, much like the blue bar which displays when a location-based app such as Google Maps or Waze is active in the background. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/39963079/532513">This red bar can’t be hidden</a>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To see this in action (another “experiment” !!), download an app like <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/awesome-voice-recorder/id892208399?mt=8">Awesome Voice Recorder</a> which advertises background recording, start a recording, and then switch anywhere else. The red bar looks like this (I’ve switched the app permissions screen in iOS settings, so you can also see where to disable the microphone permissions):

            alt="AVR is recording in the background, so iOS shows this red bar at the top. If you tap on the red bar, it will switch to the app which is recording. This is related to the blue bar for location, and the green bar for ongoing phone calls."/> </a><figcaption>
            <p>AVR is recording in the background, so iOS shows this red bar at the top. If you tap on the red bar, it will switch to the app which is recording. This is related to the blue bar for location, and the green bar for ongoing phone calls.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>
</p>
<p>With the above measures in place, it would be fairly tricky for an iOS app to perform background recording without your knowledge.</p>
<p>For some extra peace of mind, you can disable the app’s (a totally random example being Facebook) microphone permissions. If the app ever really needs to record, iOS will have to ask your permission again.</p>
<p>P.S. In iOS, under Settings | Privacy | Microphone you can find a handy list of all apps that have successfully requested microphone permissions. From here, you can also easily remove any of these permissions.</p>

<h1 id="deletefacebook-part-deux">#DeleteFacebook, part deux</h1>
<p>In an unsurprising (to me) turn of events, the Cambridge Analytica scandal has not even caused a dent in Facebook usage.</p>
<p>#deletefacebook, also discussed in a <a href="/2018/03/25/weekly-head-voices-137/#deletefacebook">previous edition of the WHV</a>, never really happened.</p>
<p>To the contrary, it seems people even <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/people-increased-facebook-usage-after-cambridge-analytica-scandal-2018-5?IR=T">increased their usage, post-scandal</a>. FB share price is back where it used to be, and as an interesting data point, Deutsche Bank reports that their FB-based advertising reach was unaffected by the removable of more than 500 million fake facebook accounts.</p>
<p>Should we deduce anything more from this than the usual 1. humans, even outraged ones, have really short memories and/or 2. most people don’t have the energy to resist, or the presence of mind to avoid, the deeply-seated social desires that are being exploited to varying degrees by the large social networks?</p>
<p>My personal strategy for a while now has been to make <em>liberal</em> use of the unfollow and the mute functions. It’s far from perfect, but with this it is possible to reduce drastically the stream of incoming information, and to make sure that what does come through has to do with friends that you have made the deliberate choice to connect with actively.</p>
<h1 id="shorter-focus-blocks-work-better">Shorter focus blocks work better</h1>
<p>In my eternal and sometimes decidedly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisyphus">Sysiphean</a> quest for more and better work focus, I recently started using Focus App (see Pro Tip #2 in <a href="/2018/01/07/weekly-head-voices-126-fleur-de-lis/">WHV #126</a>).</p>
<p>In short, when you activate the app’s focus mode, it kills off and then blocks anything that is remotely fun or even slightly distracting on your computer. This includes websites and applications.</p>
<p>In the beginning, I was enjoying longer (1 to 2 hour) focus blocks.</p>
<p>However, more recently I started noticing a certain recalcitrance in my focus-starting hand.</p>
<p>Especially late in the afternoons (prefrontal cortex GONE by then, remember?) the knowledge of that mega-block of mental exertion would result in highly undesirable procrastinatory behaviour. (Big words for “oh, I can probably fit in one more /r/emacs post!”)</p>
<p>Anyways, it turns out there’s another really good reason that pomodori are only 25 minutes long.</p>
<p>It’s much easier to start a 25 minute block of no-fun-focus, and then get stuck in the zone, than it is to start what your brain expects to be a multi-hour block of mental exertion.</p>
<p>Friend PK introduced me to the tiny rider trying to control the giant elephant as a metaphor for the conscious and unconscious mind (this is from the book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Happiness_Hypothesis">The Happiness Hypothesis</a>). The shorter focus block idea seems like it could be filed away under “tricks to control your stubborn elephant”.</p>
<h1 id="the-evolving-soul-of-emacs">The evolving soul of Emacs</h1>
<p>I came across this <a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/rms-lisp.html">really interesting piece by Richard Stallman</a> about the origin of Emacs, one of my favourite and probably most-used technical artifacts. It’s the multi-tool of computer software.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But, along the way, I wrote a text editor, Emacs. The interesting idea about Emacs was that it had a programming language, and the user’s editing commands would be written in that interpreted programming language, so that you could load new commands into your editor while you were editing. You could edit the programs you were using and then go on editing with them. So, we had a system that was useful for things other than programming, and yet you could program it while you were using it. I don’t know if it was the first one of those, but it certainly was the first editor like that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When an experienced user interacts with Emacs, they change it, and it changes them.</p>
<h1 id="the-opposite-of-instant-gratification">The opposite of instant gratification</h1>
<p>On Friday I started on a slightly longer than usual run.</p>
<p>It usually takes a kilometre or two before all of my running subsystems come on line, and I find my rhythm.</p>
<p>Not this time.</p>
<p>The acclimatisation discomfort in my ankles and calves didn’t fade away as it usually does. My breathing and running cadence stubbornly refused to lock on to their usual correct settings.</p>
<p>My legs felt tired.</p>
<p>It really felt like I was not supposed to be running at all, but I pressed on because at that point there was not much else I could do.</p>
<p>At the turn-around point (the bridge at the entrance to Vergelegen, with beautiful trees all around) I decided to try out some youtube advice from the evening before and do a few deep squats to freshen up my legs.</p>
<p>I started running back on legs and calves and feet which suddenly felt like they had all been replaced with brand-new rested versions of their 2-minute-ago return-to-manufacturer selves.</p>
<p>The rest of the run was of the <em>floating</em> over the ground how-is-this-possible my-smile-might-break-my-head variety.</p>
<p>Super strange.</p>
<p>I don’t think the squats did it. That was just a sort of thought-process punctuation which somehow distracted the mind-elephant for long enough to get me running again.</p>
<p>Anyways, as I was floating home, I could not help but see the whole occurrence as a fairly physical but in this case fortunately quite compact reminder that some of the most worthwhile experiences simply require perseverance with initially no gratification in sight.</p>
<h1 id="life-is-a-marathon">Life is a marathon</h1>
<p>… so sleep well, eat as healthily as you can, exercise, and try not to stress too much.</p>
<p>We’re in this for the long haul.</p>

<h1 id="wisdom-from-the-twitters">Wisdom from the Twitters</h1>
<p>Let me start this week’s edition with something that <a href="https://twitter.com/francoistweet">a friend</a> forwarded, quite ironically, from the dark underbelly of the internet, also known as “twitter”:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Daily activities to avoid:<br><br>- Consuming endless (news) feeds<br>- Discussion w/ anyone with a big ego<br>- Thinking without pen &amp; paper<br>- Arguing on Twitter<br>- Mindlessly saying yes to meetings</p>&mdash; muneeb.btc (@muneeb) <a href="https://twitter.com/muneeb/status/975432822973399042?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 18, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>Most of these resonate with me, except for arguing on twitter.</p>
<p>This is not because I disagree, but rather because I sort of went cold-twitter-turkey about a year ago, a departure which has had only positive effects on my humanity, as well as on my trust in the goodness of humans.</p>
<p>I still sometimes slip and fall into arguments on other platforms,  where the same advice unfortunately holds.</p>
<h1 id="deletefacebook">#DeleteFacebook?</h1>
<p>On the topic of online arguments, I would like to bring the next interesting conundrum to your astute attention.</p>
<p>There is at this moment quite some internet rage due to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/cambridge-analytica-files">the details that have been revealed about the extent to which the company Cambridge Analytica managed to exfiltrate social network data from facebook</a>, in order to perform extremely targeted advertising and hence psychological manipulation to get vulnerable users to vote for Trump, and to vote for Brexit leave.</p>
<p>Readers of this blog might remember that I <a href="/2017/03/25/fake-news-is-just-the-beginning/">already talked about this exact issue <em><strong>one year ago</strong></em> to the day</a>. I even cited <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/26/robert-mercer-breitbart-war-on-media-steve-bannon-donald-trump-nigel-farage">this early article in The Guardian mentioning Robert Mercer, Bannon, and Cambridge Analytica</a> and their role in geo-political interference.</p>
<p>At this point, I hope you will allow me a quick two-pronged educational intermezzo:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do read my posts carefully, and you too can be all like “I knew that a year ago you silly muggles”.</li>
<li>Probably more importantly, read <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/">The Guardian</a>. (I would like to thank the brilliant <a href="https://www.keele.ac.uk/istm/staff/edchadwick/">Dr Ed Chadwick</a> for introducing me to The Guardian so many years ago in Delft and/or Amsterdam, over either a pint of Irish stout (which he also introduced me to) and/or a Trappist.</li>
</ol>
<p>Anyways, back to my rant.</p>
<p>So the internet is angry (<em>years</em> too late), and everyone and their mom is telling each other to #DeleteFacebook.</p>
<p>I too disapprove in the strongest terms of what Cambridge Analytica and its backers did (besides the immorality of the approach, conservative thinking is really primitive), and Facebook facilitated.</p>
<p>However, I also think that we find ourselves in a tricky baby-with-bathwater situation.</p>
<p>Let me ironically summarise the two main points from a comment I posted on Facebook:</p>
<ol>
<li>What happens when the clever / privacy-conscious people leave facebook? It becomes an even bigger echo chamber for the uneducated. Is it not our duty to come and fight with a vaccine denialist, or a conservative or someone who is in some other way unenlightened now and then? (instead of arguing, you could also choose a more socratic approach, or just be that persistently cool perfectly rational actor in any discussion)</li>
<li>What replaces facebook as the admittedly flawed but largest virtual human gathering ever? Related to this: Facebook is the most <em>accessible</em> publication platform we have ever had. More people have a voice and can be heard than ever before. Do we really want to take that away?</li>
</ol>
<p>Let me know in the comments what you think. I promise I’ll only mine a little bit of your metadata.</p>
<h1 id="new-arduino-blog-posts-at-vxlabs">New arduino blog posts at vxlabs</h1>
<p>My arduino – artwork journey continues. Over on vxlabs I have published a <a href="https://vxlabs.com/2018/03/23/which-jumper-to-set-on-the-itead-xbee-shield-v1-1-for-use-with-a-3-3v-arduino/">short post on the itead shield 3.3V jumper</a>, and a much more interesting <a href="https://vxlabs.com/2018/03/24/developing-arduino-sketches-with-jetbrains-clion-a-minimal-example/">post showing a barebones solution (i.e. no additional software) to using the JetBrains CLion IDE for Arduino sketch programming</a>.</p>

<h1 id="whv-film-club-blade-runner-2049">WHV Film Club: Blade Runner 2049</h1>
<p>The original Blade Runner was an important part of my upbringing.</p>
<p>This weekend I, up to this point 100% unspoilered, finally got around to watching all but the last 30 minutes of Blade Runner 2049, and I was utterly blown away.</p>
<p>It’s true what they say: You can take just about any scene from the movie, and look at it like you look at a painting. The scenes are thought- and emotion-provoking.</p>
<p>Without giving anything away, the story is an amazing example of how great science fiction is the perfect mechanism for making us think deeply about strange but extremely relevant human situations.</p>
<h1 id="tot-gauw">Tot gauw</h1>
<p>Over the past few weeks, these blog posts have played a small but necessary role in more than one high quality human connection.</p>
<p>Each time this happens, the time I spend here feels like it has been rewarded 100 times over.</p>
<p>I thank you, and I look forward to the next time that we may meet.</p>

For the first time ever, I recorded the screencast in multiple segments and did the voice-over later. Soon these new skillz will trickle down to my publically available screencasts.</li>
<li>On that topic, having a good microphone is crucial, not only for screen recordings but also for video meetings. I recently acquired the <a href="http://www.samsontech.com/samson/products/microphones/usb-microphones/gomic/">Samson Go Mic</a> to complement my larger <a href="http://www.samsontech.com/samson/products/microphones/usb-microphones/gomic/">Samson C01U</a>. The Go is brilliant: Recorded voice quality comes close to the C01U in spite of the Go’s compact form factor, and it has a hardware switch to select either of the the built-in omni-directional, for meetings, or cardioid, for more dedicated voice recording, microphone elements.</li>
<li>Ironically, an ex-colleague posted <a href="https://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/january-february-march-2018/how-to-fix-facebook-before-it-fixes-us/">“How to Fix Facebook—Before It Fixes Us”</a> on Facebook, a long and worthwhile read on how FB is used to spread fake news that effectively manipulates public opinion, and what should be done to remedy this. Here is a choice quote to get you started:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>We still don’t know the exact degree of collusion between the Russians and the Trump campaign. But the debate over collusion, while important, risks missing what should be an obvious point: Facebook, Google, Twitter, and other platforms were manipulated by the Russians to shift outcomes in Brexit and the U.S. presidential election, and unless major changes are made, they will be manipulated again. Next time, there is no telling who the manipulators will be.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>In the same vein, I continuously try to spend as few as possible minutes on YouTube, but the one thing I will definitely continue watching is <a href="https://users.cg.tuwien.ac.at/zsolnai/">Károly Zsolnai-Fehér’s</a> brilliant <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbfYPyITQ-7l4upoX8nvctg">Two Minute Papers channel</a>! Most recently, his treatment of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.09784.pdf">Distilling a Neural Network Into a Soft Decision Tree</a>, a paper by Nicholas Frost and Geoffrey Hinton, caught my interest. In this, they address the problem of neural network explicability (it’s hard saying at a higher level <em>why</em> a neural network makes a particular decision) by deriving a soft decision tree from that trained neural network. The tree is not as accurate as the network, but is able to give plausible explanations for the network’s decisions. See the 4 minute long two minute paper video (hehe) here:</li>

It’s been 4 months since the previous post (a Weekly Head Voices), due to reasons involving work (fortunately challenging and fun), genetic offspring units but especially the youngest one who is currently developing at a frightening speed, the South African climate, and my brain suddenly starting to refuse work any later than about 19:00 every day.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>OH HI MARK.</p>
<p>(HELLO ALL MY OTHER FRIENDS WHO ARE NOT MARK!)</p>
<p>It’s been 4 months since the previous post (a Weekly Head Voices), due to reasons involving work (fortunately challenging and fun), genetic offspring units but especially the youngest one who is currently developing at a frightening speed, the South African climate, and my brain suddenly starting to refuse work any later than about 19:00 every day.</p>
<p>My brain has good reasons I have to admit, having absorbed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/24/why-lack-of-sleep-health-worst-enemy-matthew-walker-why-we-sleep">this Guardian interview with Matthew Walker</a>, director of the Center for Human Sleep Science at the University of California, Berkeley. In short, the possible effects of sleeping anything less than 7 hours per night are simply terrifying. It made me, I mean my brain, really rethink its approach to grabbing-one-more-hour-from-sleep-because-this-stuff-is-really-super-interesting.</p>
<p>Anyhow, following the probably better and more beefy example set by my previous transition post, <a href="/2017/01/05/the-2016-to-2017-transition-post/">2016-to-2017 that is</a>, I thought that a new edition would be the best way to get back into slightly more regular posting.</p>
<h1 id="2017-the-100-partial-and-spotty-review">2017: The 100% partial and spotty review</h1>
<p>I wrote 21 posts on this blog in 2017, 12 of which were Weekly Head Voices, which means I was about 23% (12 / 52) successful in terms of posting frequency with the WHV.</p>
<p>The most popular post over here was <a href="https://cpbotha.net/2017/01/09/deep-work-a-welcome-kick-in-the-butt/">Deep Work: A welcome kick in the butt</a>, published on January 9, which garnered just over 20 thousand views. From there my stats went all downhill. :)</p>
<p>More importantly than reader stats, each post, especially <a href="https://cpbotha.net/category/weekly-head-voices/">the Weekly Head Voices ones</a>, brought so much connection and satisfaction, which raises the question: Why am I not doing this more? (See my reasons above for not having posted for 4 months, I would have to guess.)</p>
<p>In 2017, I ran just over 800km, which, in contrast to my blogging frequency, is a nice improvement over the 440km I did in 2016. Experiment Alcohol Zero (EAZ) of February last year contributed significantly to my average distance and speed. Those gains were maintained and slightly extended in spite of EAZ concluding in March of last year.</p>
<p>To get an idea of what I was up to work-wise in 2017, you could consider browsing <a href="https://vxlabs.com/2017/">the posts I wrote on my nerd-blog during 2017</a>.  This will give you a bad idea, but it’s probably better than no idea, if you really needed to know.</p>
<p>Life-wise, I might have mentioned <a href="/category/weekly-head-voices/">The Weekly Head voices posts</a> before. There aren’t that many of them for 2017, but the ones that there are, are not too bad.</p>
<h1 id="2018-again-not-much-planned-at-least-not-in-public">2018: Again not much planned, at least not in public.</h1>
<p>Following the shining example of <a href="http://www.veronikach.com/progress-reports/year-of-blogging/">Dr Cheplygina</a>, I would love to become a fully paid-up member of the <em>True</em> Weekly Bloggers Club.</p>
<p>For the past 6 months I sort of went Facebook cold turkey (because reasons, mostly to do with attention-abuse and above-mentioned time scarcity). That, in addition to my unplanned blogging hiatus, feels (yes, I have those, albeit in extremely limited quantities) like it’s caused a bit of a disconnect between me and friends around the world.</p>
<p>I have very recently returned to facebook via the mobile website, and only after extremely liberal application of the “unfollow” button to whittle my feed down to just the people I have a healthy connection with. This will help me te maintain connections with the friends who use that as platform.</p>
<p><strong>My reciprocation will have to take the form of weekly updates on this blog.</strong></p>
<p>I look forward to it, and I look forward even more to welcoming you here!

Signal, the open source messaging and voice calling app that does end-to-end encryption. The whole world is using WhatsApp to message each other. I often do too, because I want to inter-operate with the rest of the world.
However, WhatsApp belongs to Facebook.
Although Facebook has promised otherwise (fast-forward a few years: Yes, they did break that promise. See updates at the end of this post.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p><em>(Post updated on January 8, 2021. See section at the end.)</em></p>

<p>The whole world is using WhatsApp to message each other. I often do too,
because I want to inter-operate with the rest of the world.</p>
<p>However, WhatsApp belongs to Facebook.</p>
<p>Although Facebook <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/24/zuckerberg-facebook-whatsapp_n_4848205.html">has promised otherwise</a> (fast-forward a few years: Yes,
they did break that promise. See updates at the end of this post.), the
temptation to link all of your WhatsApp messages with Facebook logins (a
straight-forward process, as they have the mobile phone numbers of a great
number of their users) must be <strong>quite</strong> tempting to the people at
Facebook. Imagine how well they would then be able to target their advertising,
based on their access to both your Facebook profile and your private WhatsApp
messages!</p>
<p>Fortunately, we now have an open source app, called <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> (available on
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms&amp;hl=en">Android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/za/app/signal-private-messenger/id874139669?mt=8">IOS</a> and the desktop), which performs end-to-end encryption
on all messages and voice calls that go through it. This means that absolutely
no-one is able to read your messages or eavesdrop on your voice calls, except
the intended recipients.</p>
<p>My request is that you get your contacts to install and <a href="https://theintercept.com/2015/03/02/signal-iphones-encrypted-messaging-app-now-supports-text/">start using Signal</a>
instead of WhatsApp wherever possible. At the very least some of our messages
will not be accessible to various large corporations and any other prying
eyes. If the security argument is not enough for you, there is one more
extremely important topic: Signal handles animated gifs better than WhatsApp,
at least on Android. (Telegram supports them on both Android on IOS, but it is
by default less secure than Signal). See here the results of my experiments:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Animated GIF support (most important feature in any messaging app): WhatsApp fail, Viber fail, Telegram pass, Signal pass on Android.</p>— Charl Botha 😷 #Masks4All (@cvoxel) <a href="https://twitter.com/cvoxel/status/682942239463587841?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 1, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>

<h2 id="january-8-2021">January 8, 2021</h2>
<p>By now, if you use WhatsApp, the app will have forced you to accept the new
privacy and data sharing agreement.</p>
<p>As is explained in this <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/01/whatsapp-users-must-share-their-data-with-facebook-or-stop-using-the-app/">post on
arstechnica</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Under the new terms, Facebook reserves the right to share collected data with its family of companies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, even more of the personal data of 2 billion or so WhatsApp
users will be integrated with everything Facebook knows about them and about
you, including all of your connections to each other on all of the facebook
platforms, including facebook itself, instagram and whatsapp.</p>
<p>Like many of you, to interoperate with the world I do need to keep WhatsApp,
but I would greatly prefer chatting with you on Signal.</p>

<p>Today we took a brief walk up into the mountain, as one does around these

<h2 id="when-life-hands-you-lemons-build-a-battery">When life hands you lemons, build a battery</h2>
<p>Genetic Offspring Unit (GOU) #1 had to do a show and tell at school, so I
helped her to construct a battery from 4 lemons. Besides that because of this I
got to refresh my own knowledge (can <i>you</i> remember exactly why a battery
such as this works?!) we got to chat about molecules, atoms, protons, neutrons,
electrons, atomic numbers and the periodic table.</p>
<p>The next day she quite coolly took the whole kit to school, proceeded to
connect up the disassembled kit before the class, and got the little LED to
switch on, all the while explaining in high-level 9-year-old-ish how it worked.</p>
<p>In case you’re wondering, the experiment looked like this:</p>

<p>With zinc-covered screws and heavy duty stripped copper wire, we got about 0.9V per lemon. There was enough current to light up a small 3V LED.</p>

<h2 id="taking-a-break-from-facebook">Taking a break from Facebook</h2>
<p>One of my more interesting Facebook friends announced that she was taking a break from Facebook, because “this stuff is toxic and no good”.</p>
<p>This made me evaluate what I thought of FB at the moment.</p>
<p><i>Toxic</i> is a strong word, but after thinking about this for a while, I have to admit that a large part of the time I spend on the site is probably not that good for my karma. The problem is that there are a whole bunch of friends I really would like to stay in contact with, but for the most part they are quite silent. The people that do pipe up the most on FB are people with some or other silly and/or misguided agenda.</p>
<p>Although <a href="http://cpbotha.net/2014/07/01/weekly-head-voices-76-someone-is-wrong-on-the-internet/">I have learnt to stop correcting the infinite number of people who are wrong on the internet</a>, I’m still reading their contributions, getting slightly worked up, formulating a response, and then resisting posting it, all of this a number of times per day.</p>
<p>To the question whether seeing the one or two positive and life-affirming posts is justified by a seemingly much larger number of the opposite, my response has also become to take a break from Facebook and to see for myself.</p>
<p>I’m not going to cancel my account, so I will receive notifications for example when people message me, but I’m just going to stop checking the site completely. I am also giving myself permission to post new WHV editions there now and then: It’s sometimes the best way to reach some of those silent but desirable FB friends I mentioned, because not all of them are subscribed to this blog. THAT’S A SUBTLE HINT SILENT BUT DESIRABLE FRIENDS.</p>
<p>(BTW, I’m almost 3 days in now, so far no problems. I’ll report back in future WHVs.)</p>
<h2 id="the-mind-is-a-terrible-thing-to-taste">The mind is a terrible thing to taste</h2>
<p>This week I learned about <a href="http://www.nih.gov/researchmatters/october2013/10282013clear.htm">fascinating sleeping brain research</a> (that summary is from the NIH, also see <a href="http://news.sciencemag.org/brain-behavior/2013/10/sleep-ultimate-brainwasher">this one by Science Magazine</a>) that was published in 2013.</p>
<p>In short, when mice sleep, the area between their brain cells is temporarily increased by 60% (!!), and the cerebro-spinal fluid between the cells flows much more rapidly than when they’re awake. This rapid flow literally flushes out of the brain the toxins that build up during the waking hours. HOW COOL IS THAT?!</p>








<figure><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/wpid-sciencemag_brainwash.jpg">
    <img

            <p>Toxins flushed out via bright blue channels between brain cells. Image from Science Mag summary linked above.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Going down one detail level, the researchers showed that the glial cells (the non-neuronal cells in the brain) control the flow of cerebro-spinal fluid through channels in their cell membranes. By using different coloured dyes, they showed that there was significantly more flow during sleeping than when awake, clearing out toxins twice as quickly.</p>
<p>This research took place in mice, but the researchers hypothesise that this same mechanism operates in humans, and <a href="https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/labs/nedergaard-lab/projects/glymphatic_system">are working on verifying that this is the case</a>.</p>

<p>Adding the Facebook Like button functionality wasted the most time, because there are far too many plugins and howtos that claim to work and don’t quite. I ended up using the Like plugin (<a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/like/" title="Wordpress page for like plugin">official wordpress page</a> and <a href="http://blog.bottomlessinc.com/2010/04/creating-a-wordpress-plugin-add-the-new-facebook-like-button-to-your-posts/" title="Like plugin website">plugin website</a>), because it has the best documentation that includes details on <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/like/faq/" title="Like plugin FAQ">all the ways in which things can go wrong</a>, and there are many.  I’m using the IFRAME option, also because that seems to work most of the time.  I had a hard time finding this plugin in the built-in directory, so I downloaded and installed it manually.</p>
<p>For the facebook share button, I use the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/facebook-share-new/" title="facebook share (new) button plugin homepage"><em>Facebook Share (New) Button</em> plugin</a>, and for the retweet button, I’m using the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/topsy/" title="Topsy Retweet Button plugin homepage"><em>Topsy Retweet Button</em> plugin</a>.  I installed both of them from the built-in “Plugins | Add New” directory.</p>
<p>In all three cases, I made use of the plugin options to have the buttons placed all over my blog, instead of manually editing the theme.</p>
<p>I hope that you enjoy your shiny buttons, and I look forward to seeing you for the next <a href="http://cpbotha.net/category/weekly-head-voices/" title="Weekly Head Voices category">Weekly Head Voices</a>!</p>
<p><em>P.S. feel free to click on my buttons, right below this post.</em></p>
