Welcome, dear readers, to the 206th edition of the Weekly Head Voices, covering the two weeks from Monday September 21 to Sunday October 4, 2020.
Mount Ceder beauty The weather prediction for the September 25 long weekend did not look good at all.
Temperatures in the low single digits, and rain.
We were unable to reschedule our reservation, and so, with significant trepidation, we packed our things for the weekend and made the drive to Mount Ceder.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>Welcome, dear readers, to the 206th edition of the Weekly Head Voices, covering
the two weeks from Monday September 21 to Sunday October 4, 2020.</p>
<h2 id="mount-ceder-beauty">Mount Ceder beauty</h2>
<p>The weather prediction for the September 25 long weekend did not look good at
all.</p>
<p>Temperatures in the low single digits, and rain.</p>
<p>We were unable to reschedule our reservation, and so, with significant
trepidation, we packed our things for the weekend and made the drive to Mount
Ceder.</p>
<p>As we entered the valley right before arriving at our destination, the rugged
and wonderful beauty of the surroundings quickly started dispelling our puny
expectations.</p>
<p>The weather did turn out almost exactly as was predicted, but our time there
ended up being the brilliant opposite of what we had feared.</p>
<p>In between spells of rain, there was plenty of fresh sunshine outside, with a
super effective little closed combustion fireplace inside the house to keep it
toasty.</p>

<p>The outside jacuzzi which we discovered late on the Saturday afternoon might
also have played a role in the amount of fun that was had.</p>
<p>It does also need to be said that the fact that there&rsquo;s no telephone reception
is a massive perk for us visitors.</p>
<p>The older I get, the more I enjoy disconnecting.</p>
<h2 id="vcbm-2020-virtually">VCBM 2020, virtually</h2>
<p>Thanks to the modern miracle that is virtual conferences, I was able to attend
a large part of the <a href="https://www.gcpr-vmv-vcbm-2020.uni-tuebingen.de/">Visual Computing in Biology and Medicine (VCBM) 2020
conference</a>.</p>
<p>Although I am super interested in the themes and people of this conference, it
is <em>usually</em> not possible for me to fly around the globe to take part in this
or any other relevant academic gathering.</p>
<p>However, the current pandemic has brought with it a whole host of changes, not
least of which is the concept of being able to participate, as a first class
citizen, in an international conference.</p>
<p>It was really great, although slightly nostalgic, connecting with friends and
colleagues from years ago.</p>
<p>Just being able to join in on the post-talk question sessions, and in the
surreal social rooms on discord where you find yourself in a grid of talking
heads, was super enjoyable.</p>
<p>(It has to be noted here that the technical aspects of VCBM 2020 were also
top-class. Everything, from the interactive block-based conference programme
with downloadable papers, to the youtube streams for each session, to the
discord channels for real-time discussion and the discord channels for social
video conferencing, was simply top notch!)</p>
<h3 id="multi-tasking-virtual-meetings-quo-vadis">Multi-tasking virtual meetings: Quo vadis?</h3>
<p>What was also interesting to hear, was a possibly less positive aspect of
virtual conferencing, specifically that academic peeps were now in the
situation where they often had to multi-task whilst taking part in the
conference.</p>
<p>In the old days, pre-COVID, it could definitely happen that folks had to take
care of a few emails or perhaps even a video meeting, but the majority of the
day would be spent conferencing.</p>
<p>That is, people from potentially right around the globe would be chatting
face-to-face about anything and everything, an activity which is truly
important for collaboration, and friendship.</p>
<p>Now it seems that this ratio has changed, where most of the time folks are
expected to be available online for additional tasks and interactions, while
conferencing in parallel.</p>
<p>In my day job I&rsquo;ve noticed a similar phenomenon, where one can often notice
that people taking part in a meeting are only partially present.</p>
<p>Whilst this is perhaps a good thing for a number of meetings that are by their
nature not that efficient, I think that it&rsquo;s a dangerous habit to
cultivate.</p>
<p>Imagine that by default, every meeting means your poor cognition trying to keep
up with multiple streams of information at the same time. Looking at it from a
different perspective, now you have even less confidence that your
collaborators are paying attention to what is being discussed.</p>
<p>This might be yet another reason to <a href="/2020/09/20/weekly-head-voices-205-real-time-sometimes-async-most-of-the-time/#the-future-of-work-episode-23">favour asynchronous offline communication</a>,
that is, writing long-form messages on message boards, with synchronous
face-time being reserved more and more for purely social reasons.</p>
<h2 id="on-thursday-october-1-too-much-distraction-was-too-much">On Thursday October 1, too much distraction was too much</h2>
<p>Seguing right on from the synchronous communication point above, On October 1 I
unfortunately needed to be jacked-in to Teams, WhatsApp <em>and</em> Discord for the
whole day, for various good reasons.</p>
<p>It was only around 16:20 that I was able to snap out of all of this and jack
out again, with <a href="https://lazarfocused.com/">Lazar Focus</a> helping to bring a bit of welcome rest and,
surprise(!), focus.</p>
<p>Before that, anxiety about possibly missing something kept me from plugging out
for even short bursts to be able to do work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny how the expectations, real or perhaps more often just perceived, of
one&rsquo;s surroundings make it extremely difficult to disconnect, which leads to
more time lost to these various forms of distraction, which leads to further
anxiety, which further complicates just taking those few steps back and pulling
the plug.</p>
<p>I wish I had a trick to manage all of this better.</p>
<h2 id="that-time-i-nuked-all-of-my-computers-with-a-partition-resize-and-move-that-should-have-taken-no-more-than-5-minutes">That time I nuked all of my computers with a partition resize and move that should have taken no more than 5 minutes</h2>
<p><em>Massive nerd warning: If you don&rsquo;t want to know about filesystems, feel free</em>
<em>to skip this section. Before you do however, take this advice from me: Avoid</em>
<em>AOMEI.</em></p>
<p>My goal was simple: Move the newly appeared recovery partition (in addition to
the one at the start of the disk) to its end, so that I can grow my main system
partition to fill the available space on the drive.</p>
<p>Some years ago I had used EaseUs for something similar, but they wanted payment
for this task, and current reviews were pointing quite convincingly in the
direction of AOMEI.</p>
<p>Narrator: <em>The reviews were all tragically wrong.</em></p>
<p>My specific use case is even documented exactly on the AOMEI website, see <a href="https://www.diskpart.com/windows-10/windows-10-move-recovery-partition-4348.html">this
page</a>.</p>
<p>I followed those steps exactly.</p>
<p>My computer rebooted twice in order to perform the two actions:</p>
<ol>
<li>move recovery partition, and</li>
<li>resize system partition&hellip;</li>
</ol>
<p>&hellip; to conclude finally by leaving my laptop in a 100% unusable state.</p>
<p>No boot, no nothing.</p>
<p>I tried various combinations of booting into safe mode, which worked at first
but showed me the full drive&rsquo;s space available, meaning that the filesystem had
probably been damaged.</p>
<p>Hard.</p>
<p>I later booted with Windows installation media, from where I launched various
rescue attempts, including the stalwart <code>bootrec /rebuildbcd</code> and all of its
friends.</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>AOMEI had done a pretty great job in completely destroying my partition table
and filesystem.</p>
<p>Narrator: <em>He got what he paid for!</em></p>
<p>I ended up installing Windows 10 twice, the second time with the
soon-to-be-released 20H2 install media, because installing the old 1909 and
then upgrading was taking far too long.</p>
<p>The whole exercise, or should I say &ldquo;lesson&rdquo;, cost me about a day.</p>
<p>Stoic narrator: <em>Fortunately, the situation afterwards was better than it was before.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>My main WSL2 ubuntu 20.04 image, where most of my development work happens,
remained untouched on the second SSD and was up and running pretty quickly
after the Windows re-install.</li>
<li>My backups demonstrably work, although Windows File History is truly klunky
compared to Apple&rsquo;s Time Machine.</li>
<li>In the chaos of trying to get my work environment back up and running, I also
had to upgrade my deep learning Linux desktop machine to Ubuntu 20.04. (It
started as a Murphy&rsquo;s law situation, where both my laptop <em>and</em> the desktop
were unusable, the latter due to a stupid Ubuntu bug manifesting as a
non-working keyboard)</li>
<li>A fresh install of Windows feels really fresh.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="my-mind-is-a-slippery-eel">My mind is a slippery eel</h2>
<p>Recently I had to work on a chunk of software system design.</p>
<p>It starts with nothing laid down, just a general idea of what this pretty
significant feature should be able to do.</p>
<p>Pulling yourself up by your bootstraps, you have to start laying down the
bottom-most levels of the design that will eventually be able to make those
high-level desired features a reality.</p>
<p>This whole growing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube%5FGoldberg%5Fmachine">Rube Goldberg machine</a> has to stay in your mind for a large
part of the day, as you&rsquo;re mentally twisting, turning and replacing bits here
and there.</p>
<p>Most of these days, getting my brain to stay focused felt a lot like trying to
hold on to a really slippery eel, and, if that wasn&rsquo;t tricky enough, trying to
aim the sporadically working laser, badly mounted on its slippery head, to try
and carve something recognisable from a block of slowly melting ice.</p>
<p>By the end of most days, it would mostly not feel like it had been very
productive.</p>
<p>I tried to make peace with the fact that some sorts of work, coupled with all
of the usual emotional interactions, would often result in this sort of
feeling.</p>
<p>In that moment, this did also help me to get back into the habit of daily
meditation practice. Fortunately there&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.wakingup.com/">the Waking Up app by Sam Harris</a> which
is perfect for this. Using this, I am usually able to squeeze in a 10 minute
practice before work starts, which subjectively seems to bring a little more
equanimity into each day.</p>
<p>Looking back at this experience now, it also seems like a strong vote for
paying more attention to the daily &ldquo;done&rdquo; list.</p>
<p>Although I mostly remember to journal every day, I often forget to look at it
also from the perspective of compactly listing the little tasks that have been
completed.</p>
<p>This could be tricky when working on an amorphous project like &ldquo;design this
vague thing&rdquo;, but I think that it&rsquo;s more about the ritual of formulating and
then reviewing a small but plausible thing that is now apparently done.</p>
<p>This seems to fool the anxious parts of one&rsquo;s brain into a semblance of
temporary calm, enabling some of the other parts to get back to work.</p>
<p>This too I shall file this under <a href="/tags/101-mind-tricks">&ldquo;101 stupid but effective tricks to fool your
mind into being more useful&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>P.S. I just discovered that some part of <a href="/2019/01/26/weekly-head-voices-160-write-stuff-down/#do-you-write-stuff-down">January-2019-Charl already did</a>.</p>
<p>P.P.S. &ldquo;Fool your mind&rdquo;, although it sounds much less awesome than &ldquo;free your
mind&rdquo;, seems to be a recurring aspect of effectively operating the human
machine.</p>

<h2 id="sleep-update">Sleep update</h2>
<p>With our teenager back in school, we have to get up at 5:45, mercifully only
for two days of the week with the school in COVID-19-mode.</p>
<p>On other days we get to sleep in until 6:45. LUXURY!</p>
<p>(The lock-down also saved us from a few months of 5:45 wake-ups 5 time per
week during the darkest part of the winter, so there&rsquo;s that.)</p>
<p>This, together with increased pressure at work, has again brought into sharp
focus my sleep hygiene.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t been doing too badly during the past months, but the current period
seemed to require a tad more attention to good sleep.</p>
<p>After reading the disappointing news that the promised first-party (Apple, in
other words) sleep-tracking in the new WatchOS 6 release was not going to be
much more than tracking time in bed, I searched around for the best third-party
sleep tracking app.</p>
<p>Well folks, after a few weeks of testing, I think that <a href="http://autosleep.tantsissa.com/">AutoSleep</a> is it!</p>
<p>(Beware, there&rsquo;s a straight rip-off app in the Google Play store. It&rsquo;s not even
in the same reality as the real thing, although the scammers have stolen a
bunch of visual elements and even copy from the real autosleep website. Oh
Android&hellip;)</p>
<p>The app appears to be almost too full of complicated-looking visual gizmos, so
much so that initially I was not as positive about it. See below for an example
of my sleep history overview:</p>








<figure><a href="autosleep_screenshot.png">

</figure>

<p>However, after using it for a while, and coming to grips with the various
pieces of feedback, this app has turned out to be a great tool in my quest for
sleep hygiene nirvana.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I did have to change my watch charging habits by charging my watch
in the evening hours, so that I can sleep with it on my wrist, and I also have
to remember to tap the &ldquo;lights out&rdquo; button when I attempt to start my sleep
(you don&rsquo;t have to do this, but it gives more accurate tracking that way).</p>
<p>Now I have measurements to show how important the wind-down routine is (if I
can fit in some book-reading in bed, I can fall asleep after that in almost no
time); how some nights when it feels like I&rsquo;m quite restless, I actually do get
quite an amount of sleep; and finally how a drink or two on a weekend night can
affect my average heart rate through the night (+5 beats, oof), and more.</p>
<h2 id="wsl2-and-nativecomp-emacs-workflow-update">WSL2 and nativecomp Emacs workflow update</h2>
<p>The following is for my more nerdy readers.</p>
<p>After running into <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/4619#issuecomment-678652118">this comment</a> on a github issue I am subscribed to, I learned
that you can use the versatile <a href="http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/">socat</a> tool to forward connections from a unix
socket on WSL2, via the WSL bridge and a WSL1 instance, to a TCP port on
localhost.</p>
<p>The upshot of this is that I now have a robust X11 connection from WSL2 to X410
running on my Windows laptop.</p>
<p>This is possible without socat, but you either need to forward ports using SSH
(which I&rsquo;ve done), or punch holes in the firewall, and then, as if that&rsquo;s not
bad enough, deal with a connection that breaks every time the laptop goes into
suspend.</p>
<p>With the socat X11 connection in place, I decided that it was time to go
further around the WSL2 bend and replace my complicated rsync-based scripts for
copying source code from the Windows host to the WSL2-native filesystem with a
second instance of dropbox running directly on WSL2, with a severe selective
sync configuration.</p>
<p>By the way, after <a href="https://dropbox.tech/infrastructure/rewriting-the-heart-of-our-sync-engine">Dropbox rewrote their sync engine (in Rust)</a>, nothing else
even comes close in terms of performance.</p>
<p>Thanks to this perfect storm of socat-X11-boosted WSL2 and MULTI-dropbox, I
decided that it was finally time to commit to <a href="https://akrl.sdf.org/gccemacs.html">the new nativecomp Emacs &ldquo;capable
of compiling and running Emacs Lisp as native code&rdquo;</a>, so I busted out my
slightly modified version of <a href="https://masteringemacs.org/article/speed-up-emacs-libjansson-native-elisp-compilation">Mickey Petersen&rsquo;s</a> Dockerfile and compiled me one.</p>
<p>This very post is being written on native-compiled Emacs Lisp, running on WSL2,
displaying via socat to X410.</p>

issue. The future is now.)</p>
<h2 id="keyboard-update-unicorns-with-rgb">Keyboard update: Unicorns-with-RGB</h2>
<p>You might remember from <a href="/2020/07/19/weekly-head-voices-200-we-are-extremely-pleased-to-be-here/#my-attempt-at-dipping-my-toes-carefully-into-the-world-of-mechanical-keyboards">WHV #200 how I carefully started dipping my toes in the
clickity-clackety waters of mechanical keyboards</a> by acquiring a cheap keyboard
with hot-swappable <a href="https://input.club/the-comparative-guide-to-mechanical-switches/tactile-clicky/outemu-blue/">Outemu blue switches</a>.</p>
<p>What I did not tell you then, was that shortly after acquiring that keyboard, I
had already ordered the <a href="https://youtu.be/e9gRESbY-e8">Womier K87 all-acrylic RGB-overload keyboard</a> from
Banggood.</p>
<p>My reason for ordering that specific board was not so much the lighting (WHICH
IS FREAKING SPECTACULAR BUT BACK THEN I DID NOT KNOW THIS), but rather because
it was the most affordable mechanical keyboard with universal(-ish)
hotswappable switches.</p>
<p>You see, the Outemu board can only take Outemu switches, while with a board
with universal sockets, you have access to a whole smorgas(key)bord of
different switches!</p>
<p>The Womier finally arrived after slightly more than a month, with <a href="https://input.club/the-comparative-guide-to-mechanical-switches/tactile/gateron-brown/">Gateron brown
switches</a> installed as I had requested.</p>
<p>Probably due to both the brown switches (rated 45g actuation force but probably
less, tactile but not clicky) and due to the board&rsquo;s far more solid
composition, my typing comfort and speed on this thing are close to what I
usually have on my Microsoft Sculpt ergonomic.</p>
<p>Because of this, I don&rsquo;t swap back to the Sculpt nearly as often.</p>
<p>Together with the fact that the keyboard has an impressive and varied
collection of intricate animated lighting patterns thanks to the RGB LED behind
each and every single key, and a whole bunch of extra LEDs in the acrylic body,
this leads to a great deal of typing fun.</p>

<h2 id="running-update">Running update</h2>
<p>Back in <a href="/2019/09/09/weekly-head-voices-177-streakers/">WHV #177</a> I embraced the space and acquired my first pair of Altras, a
pair of road shoes named Escalante 1.0, for a good price, because the 1.5 had
already been released.</p>
<p>Recently I was again in the fortunate position to buy a pair of 1.5s for a good
price, as, you guessed it, the 2.0 had already been released.</p>
<p>The new babies look like this:</p>

<p>Running in them has been super enjoyable.</p>
<p>(The 1.0s are at about 700km, which is usually a good time to retire them from
running. Now they are just for cocktail parties and business meetings.)</p>
<p>On a more philosophical note, with the aforementioned improving weather, the
aforementioned increased pressure at work, and the non-aforementioned abundance
of mountains all around me, I have taken to randomly taking a few hours off
from aforementioned work to go run in the now aforementioned mountains.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-your-purpose">What is your purpose?</h2>
<p>We have a great tradition here at the WHV of revising our official and utterly
complete life philosophy based on discussions with wise friends.</p>
<p>See for example <a href="/2017/07/30/weekly-head-voices-124-ceci-nest-pas-dennui/">WHV #124</a> where I had to add a third rule to <em>WHV&rsquo;s Two Rules
for Achieving Great Success in Life, or Just Surviving, Whichever Comes First</em>.</p>
<p>Quite poetically, the additional rule was &ldquo;Evolve&rdquo;.</p>
<p>(FYI, the current official WHV approach to life, the universe and everyhing is
summarised in <a href="/2020/06/16/weekly-head-voices-198-short-update-for-future-me/#post-scriptum-the-whv-approach-to-life-the-universe-and-everything">WHV #198</a>.)</p>
<p>During the beautifully-surrounded lunch discussion with longest-time friend
(LTF, henceforth), as depicted in the panoramic photo at the start of this
post, we also spent some time talking about life directions vs. goals.</p>
<p>As you know, I am <a href="/2012/01/28/slow-philosophy-weekly-head-voices-64/">not a fan of life goals, instead opting for life directions</a>.</p>
<p>LTF agreed with some of my reasoning, but made the valid point that goals were
required to measure and maintain velocity along one&rsquo;s chosen directions, or
<a href="/2020/01/12/the-2019-to-2020-transition-post/#plans-and-life-directions-for-2020">systems</a>.</p>
<p>In principle we agree on this point also, but I believe that the conversation
will have to continue, as we still need to define and then articulate a
closed-form solution to the directions vs goals issue, or rather a guideline
that can be used to determine the correct relative dosage.</p>
<p>Probably more important was LTF&rsquo;s contribution of the concept of &ldquo;purpose&rdquo;.</p>
<p>One could argue that life directions form one&rsquo;s purpose, but that would be
missing an opportunity I think.</p>
<p>As LTF later quipped:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Purpose = the reason you get up in the morning. Goals = help you go to sleep at
night.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At least in my case, I have a number of life directions, but I think a purpose
is a higher-level, mostly singular, desired outcome of your life&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>Ideally, <em>life directions</em> should be set in order to orient one towards
fulfilling one&rsquo;s <em>purpose</em>, with continuously evolving <em>goals</em> punctuating the way
there.</p>
<p>What is <em>your</em> purpose?</p>

<p>This edition of the Weekly Head Voices looks back at the week from Monday May
11 to Sunday May 17, 2020.</p>
<p>The rest of this post consists of a part about keyboards, a part chock full of
ways to waste your time with WSL and f#, a part about why you might be wasting
your time with aforementioned, and then finally a part about a really
interesting book.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t like keyboards, and you&rsquo;re wondering in a non-curious way what a
WSL is, I would strongly recommend that you jump to the part, at the end of the
post, about the really interesting book.</p>
<h2 id="ergonomic-keyboard-one-way-street">Ergonomic keyboard one-way street</h2>
<p>As you will recall from <a href="/2020/05/03/weekly-head-voices-193-covid-19-part-3/#microsoft-sculpt-ergonomic-desktop-at-4-years-rip">the thrilling events of episode #193</a>, one of my two
(home-office and office-office) Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic keyboards gave up
the ghost.</p>
<p>After far too many keyboard reviews and a fruitless search for a worthy
alternative, I indeed gave up and tried to make peace with the fact that over
the coming years I&rsquo;ll be slowly buying up the rest of the world&rsquo;s Sculpt
supply.</p>
<p>My secret campaign got off to a pretty unspectacular start as I was able to
find exactly one (1) online retailer that was able to supply at this moment.</p>
<p>I mundanely ordered the thing, and it was pretty mundanely delivered to my
house a few days later.</p>
<p>After some breaking in, I am happy to report that a brand-new Sculpt indeed
feels a great deal more amazing than a 4-year-old Sculpt.</p>
<p>As backups for any additional future apocalyptic situations, I also bought two
much cheaper &ldquo;normal&rdquo; keyboards, namely <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-us/products/keyboards/wired-keyboard-600/anb-00001">the Microsoft Wired Keyboard 600</a>.</p>
<p>I tried typing on one just to see what it was like, but more specifically to
develop some sort of intuition for if I would ever be able to return to
straight boards.</p>
<p>To be quite frank, my first impressions were pretty horrible.</p>
<p>Wrists having to bend outwards like that is positively uncomfortable, while the
keys on that unit make for a solid 14 on the 10-point mushiness scale.</p>
<p>One could perhaps get used to the mushiness, or preferably just invest in a
more expensive (mechanical) keyboard, but that ulnar deviation is a total deal
breaker.</p>
<p>My dreams of joining the clickety-clackety cliques of the mechanical keyboard
digerati had been shattered, fortunately quite cheaply.</p>
<p>Instead, I shall be redoubling my Sculpt stockpiling efforts.</p>
<h2 id="interlude-of-even-more-nerdy-miscellany-dot">Interlude of even more nerdy miscellany.</h2>
<p>On Friday evening I was sucked into Windows and WSL2 again.</p>
<p>I stayed up a bit too late because I discovered that instead of displaying to
X410 on Windows, which is slightly painful with WSL2 due to port redirects
and/or firewalling and/or the connection dying every time the Windows host
suspends, one can also start xrdp on WSL2, and then connect to that with
Windows remote desktop.</p>
<p>For WSL2, this is much more robust than X11, and for some use-cases it offers a
better experience. (I&rsquo;m writing this on Tuesday, and <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/the-windows-subsystem-for-linux-build-2020-summary/">MSBuild has just made a
number of super relevant announcements with regard to native WSL2 Linux GUI
support</a>. For the demo of WSL2 Linux GUI apps, they were displaying to Wayland
on WSL2 and connecting to that using RDP.)</p>
<p>On Saturday, I wrestled with and was solidly trounced by .net core 5 preview 3
and the preview of F# 5.</p>
<p>My goal was to try out the <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-f-5-preview-1/">new <code>r# nuget</code> package references</a>, and specifically
to try this out with the PowerShell type provider in <a href="https://github.com/fsprojects/FSharp.Management">FSharp.Management</a>.</p>
<p>At this point, I also can&rsquo;t tell you exactly why.</p>
<p>I now believe that this was just an instance of the eternal and far broader
learn-something-completely-new vs. work-on-some-compounding-activity conundrum.</p>
<p>(I would later learn that Fsharp.Management has not been updated in a while,
and the packages are not compatible with netcore or netstandard.)</p>
<p>Probably more importantly, I learned that when you&rsquo;re an utter F# noob like me
you should probably just avoid the bleeding edge altogether.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called the <em>bleeding</em> edge for good reason.</p>
<h3 id="the-story-behind-this-story-one-context-to-rule-them-all">The story behind this story: One context to rule them all!</h3>
<p>When I bought my ex-MacBook Pro 2017 in 2017 on my birthday, you might remember
<a href="/2017/09/05/weekly-head-voices-125/#new-laptop">how I justified it then</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Up to then, I had been working on all of three different machines:
Linux-running i7 desktop (acquired in Feb of 2015), early 2015 13″ retina
MacBook Pro (acquired in June of 2015) and my trusty old klunky i7 Acer
Linux-running laptop (acquired around March 2013).</p>
<p>Data is kept in sync, but context switching between different projects with
different development environments on different machines at home and at work
does seem to take up more time than I would care to admit.</p>
<p>Having everything on a single powerful-enough laptop would indeed make the most
sense from a time-efficiency perspective.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That part of the MacBook Pro experiment worked out quite well: The hardware and
software was good enough for <em>everything</em> that I needed to do, so I hardly ever
needed to context switch out of the laptop.</p>
<p>Although <a href="/2019/04/27/new-laptop-2019/">the new ThinkPad</a> is more powerful, the fact that I reboot multiple
times per day in and out of Windows and two different Linux configurations on
the laptop is almost like having three different machines, which of course
kills the whole single context dream.</p>
<p>(spoiler alert: In the book-review section after this, context-switching is one
of the main villains!)</p>
<p>Anyways, the reason I keep on returning to WSL2 and then wasting time trying to
make it work more like native Linux and to integrate better with my workflow on
Windows is because I would really like to get rid of this specific context
switch.</p>
<h2 id="pragmatic-thinking-and-learning">Pragmatic Thinking and Learning</h2>
<p>This past weekend I finished reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3063393-pragmatic-thinking-and-learning">Pragmatic Thinking &amp; Learning - Refactor
Your Wetware (ed: ahem) by Andy Hunt</a>.</p>
<p>The book is chock full of valuable guidelines for trying to improve the way in
which I apply the limited mental energy I have at my disposal.</p>
<p>(Quite ironically, it felt like the weekend was pretty much me flying right in
the face of just about every piece of advice in the book.)</p>
<p>Here is a selection of the notes I made, slightly massaged for your
consumption. Bon appetit!</p>
<ul>
<li>Make room for the creative part of your brain to fly. First pour in some
reading and structured thinking, and then take a walk, stare out into space,
shower (again), take a nap, make a drawing upside-down. Do whatever&rsquo;s
required to shut logical Spock voice up for a while. When the ideas start
flying in, and they do, switch logical Spock voice back on to structure and
process them.</li>
<li>Build and start using an exocortex. (The reason I bought this book, is
because it was pointed out to me as a good reference for the context and term
<em>exocortex</em>. I&rsquo;m planning to write more about it <a href="https://cpbotha.net/2020/05/03/weekly-head-voices-193-covid-19-part-3/#the-amazing-niklas-luhmann-and-his-zettelkasten">here</a> and <a href="https://orgmode-exocortex.com/">elsewhere</a>.)</li>
<li>Science says that happiness enhances cognition. In other words, when you&rsquo;re
happier, you&rsquo;re really smarter.</li>
<li><strong>Write drunk, revise sober.</strong></li>
<li>Get in the habit of collecting snippets of your writing. That&rsquo;s what the
exocortex is for. You might be surprised at what you&rsquo;re able to construct
with all of the snippets you collect over time. In the book, this is called
the Fieldstone method, but it sounds suspiciously similar to slips of paper
in a slipbox, aka Zettelkasten.</li>
<li>Formulate SMART goals, that is Specific, Measurable, Achivable, Relevant and
Time-boxed. If you read this blog, you&rsquo;re probably &ldquo;smart&rdquo; enough (dad joke,
sorry) to figure out why this is good.</li>
<li>Manage your mind along three axes:
<ol>
<li>Increase focus and attention, e.g. by training focus and attention also
through practising meditation and by sometimes just doing nothing. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple%5Fdrafts%5Fmodel">Daniel
Dennett&rsquo;s <em>multiple drafts</em> model of consciousness</a> is discussed here,
super interesting stuff.
<ul>
<li>On that note, your whole brain and all of its high-level capabilities
are squarely in the use-it-or-lose-it camp.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Manage your knowledge. You guessed it: Exocortex.</li>
<li>Optimise your current context. Keep in your view only what is required to
work on the current thing. Minimise context switching. Avoid distractions
and manage interruptions.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, that was basically my exocortex flexing for you.</p>
<p>ANYWAYS</p>
<p>After all of that, my favourite part of the book was this:</p>

        /> </a>
</figure>

<p>For those of you viewing this blog in its 100% text-only form, the screenshot
above is of the part of the text explaining that not every day is going to be a
productive one.</p>
<p>I highlighted that, and added the comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some days gonna be crap.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As life goes on, I have come to the realisation that no matter how hard you
work and how much you practise, the days when everything seems to go right
according to plan are truly scarce and should be celebrated.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably best to make peace with that fact, and simply to never stop
trying.</p>
<p>Also remember that it is quite possible to bend time just a little bit so as to
create a little more space around the small victories and pleasures that one
experiences even on <em>those</em> days.</p>
<p>See you around friends!</p>

<h2 id="intermezzo-for-computer-nerds-wsl2">Intermezzo for computer nerds: WSL2.</h2>
<p>Microsoft released <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2019/11/11/releasing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-19013-into-the-slow-ring/">Windows build 19013 onto the Windows Insider Preview slow
ring</a>, along with the shiny new WSL2.</p>
<p>WSL is a truly interesting development in the evolution of Windows that enables
users to run arbitrary Linux binaries with full Windows integration.</p>
<p>I run a true-blue Linux installation of Emacs on WSL, displaying to X410 on the
Windows side, manipulating files on the native Windows NTFS filesystem.</p>
<p>This is substantially faster for some or other reason than running native
Windows Emacs.</p>
<p>Anyways, WSL2 is the next significant jump for WSL where Microsoft is now
shipping a native Linux kernel together with Windows and exposing this kernel
via a light-weight Hyper-V utility VM with dynamic host memory allocation.</p>
<p>I was planning to wait until it got released on stable, but when MS announced
that it was available on the slow ring of the Windows Insider Previews, the
temptation was too great.</p>
<p><a href="/2019/04/27/new-laptop-2019/">The ThinkPad, my main development machine</a>, is
now running this hopefully relatively safe Windows preview.</p>
<p>At this point, I can report that WSL2&rsquo;s IO on its own local filesystem is
indeed much faster than WSL&rsquo;s. However, IO on the host NTFS filesystem is three
to four times slower&hellip;</p>
<p>This is indeed <em>quite</em> disappointing, as my work use-cases all involve
accessing files on the NTFS side in some or other way.</p>
<p>An unexpected bonus of WSL2 however, is the Docker integration.</p>
<p>Docker for Windows Edge is able to use WSL2 as a backend, meaning much, much
faster starting and general usage of docker containers on Windows.</p>
<p>I really hope that MS is able to improve the 9p-based NTFS IO performance of
WSL2 to at least that of WSL.</p>
<p>Far more unrealistically, I hope that MS finally retires NTFS and replaces it
with something better.</p>
<p>Windows really has been making great strides over the past
years. Unfortunately, NTFS is a gigantic ball and chain that is currently doing
a great job of holding the whole of Windows back.</p>
<h2 id="running">Running.</h2>
<p>At the start of 2019, I wrote that I had an <a href="/2019/01/06/the-2018-to-2019-transition-post/#looking-forward-1">&ldquo;additional concrete (but very
humble) running-related resolution for 2019, but I have decided to keep that
quiet until it’s in the
pocket&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s in the pocket and now I can talk about it.</p>
<p>On Saturday morning I went out for my usual longer weekend run (longer is
anything greater than 10km).</p>
<p>It was cool for this time of the year, and there was almost no
wind.</p>
<p>Importantly, I had had a solid night of sleep.</p>
<p>As I was going out, Morning-Voice whispered in my head: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s highly probably
now, or never again in 2019&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>My longer weekend run proceeded to morph successfully into the casual 20km run
that I had envisioned as my most concrete 2019 running goal.</p>
<p>Achievement unlocked!</p>
<p>Although I had indeed formulated the goal as &ldquo;doing a casual 20km run&rdquo;, the
<em>actual</em> goal was being fit enough to be able to do so more or less on a whim.</p>
<p>For my next trick, I&rsquo;ll try my best not to let it slip back too far.</p>
<p>OH HAI THERE LOOMING HOLIDAY SEASON!</p>
<h2 id="things-are-not-always-what-they-seem">Things are not always what they seem.</h2>
<p>After the morning run, we met with multi-decade close friends for lunch at the
restaurant Gåte at Quoin Rock.</p>
<p>That alternative &ldquo;å&rdquo;, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%85">also known as the
a-ring</a>, should give the first clue that
this place is hipper even than any of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefon">Stefon&rsquo;s
recommendations</a>.</p>
<p>I found the whole experience to be quite magical.</p>
<p>The 25 year old genius chef, Nicole Loubser, together with her team, has
constructed the most amazing culinary experience.</p>
<p>See the airport coffee and cigar below for example:</p>

<p>Our company, together with the beautiful surroundings and the party that had
entered via my mouth into my sensory system, made for a truly sublime
afternoon.</p>
<h2 id="electro-backyard-philosophy">Electro-backyard-philosophy.</h2>
<p>TPN recently and very fortunately pointed out that <a href="https://jorisvoorn.com/">Joris
Voorn</a>, probably my favourite electro artist, has a
new album out.</p>
<p>The album is of course called \\\\.</p>
<p>Below is an excerpt from the lyrics of track 8, <em>This City (feat. Lazarusman)</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are not alone.</p>
<p>When you have yourself.</p>
<p>How can you be alone<br>
How can you be alone when you have yourself?<br>
When you have you?</p>
<p>it is you mastering the art, the tai chi, of you</p>
<p>it is you realising that these fleeting moments are all for you</p>
<p>you have yourself<br>
you are not alone</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To my mind, these words contain echoes of both mindfulness and of
transcendental idealism, all on the background of an über hip electro beat.</p>
<p>At the almost 2 hour mark, these echoes contributed much pleasure to the mental
aspects of my run.</p>
<p>Now when I listen to it in a different state of mind, it is clear that the
music made the impact that it did due to the specific set of circumstances at
that moment.</p>
<p>This is a good demonstration of how dependent an experience can be, and how
fickle and unpredictable one&rsquo;s preferences.</p>
<p>(How do we <em>ever</em> make good choices?)</p>
<p>Whatever the case may be, I have chosen to keep hold of the lessons,
irrespective of the subjective ephemerality of their container.</p>
