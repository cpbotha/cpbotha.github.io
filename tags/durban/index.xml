We have just returned from a ridiculously enjoyable holiday in The Drakensberg, or uKhahlamba in isiZulu.
More specifically, we started in Giant’s Castle, the place of no internet mentioned in the previous edition of the WHV, and also the subject of that post’s main image, but we spent the largest part of the week at Cathedral Peak.
Due to it having been holiday and all, the rest of this post will follow the trusty old bullet list form.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>Well hello there friends!</p>
<p>We have just returned from a ridiculously enjoyable holiday in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drakensberg">The Drakensberg, or uKhahlamba in isiZulu</a>.</p>
<p>More specifically, we started in Giant’s Castle, the place of no internet mentioned in the <a href="/2018/04/02/weekly-head-voices-138-born-to-run/">previous edition of the WHV</a>, and also the subject of that post’s main image, but we spent the largest part of the week at Cathedral Peak.</p>
<p>Due to it having been holiday and all, the rest of this post will follow the trusty old bullet list form.</p>
<ul>
<li>The mountainous surroundings are stunningly beautiful.</li>
<li>At Giant’s Peak we did the short hike to the main caves to see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_rock_art">rock art by the San people</a>. According to the guide the paintings we saw range in age between 100 and 3000 years. Here are two examples:</li>

<li>We did more hikes in the mountains. GOU#3, who just turned 2, was a trooper, relatively speaking. We will never again mention all of the kilometres that we had to carry her.</li>
<li>I squeezed in a number of trail runs. It’s a badly kept secret that I have absolutely no sense of direction. This, together with the routes finding themselves at 1400m altitude, made for challenging but awe-inspiring trips.</li>
<li>On the way back home, we stopped in Durban for the most amazing curries at <a href="https://www.oysterboxhotel.com/food-and-drink/curry-buffet">The Oyster Box</a>. Me = blown away.</li>
<li>At the airport, that thing I said would never happen to me, happened to me. At the security check, we discovered that I had forgotten my trusty Leatherman Wave multi-tool in my backpack, and my trusty <a href="/2018/02/11/weekly-head-voices-131-function-over-form/">Gerber Dime mini multi-tool</a> in my trouser pocket. In a massively pleasant surprise turn of events, I was able to go back out through security, where the amazingly helpful British Airways check-in attendant calmly packaged up the offending tools in a spare box, labeled it, and sent it through with the checked baggage, and to return to my people all in the space of about 15 minutes.</li>
<li>We hit a thunderstorm, initially undetected by the weather radar, on our way back to Cape Town for some of the scariest turbulence I’ve ever experienced.
<ul>
<li>At one point, the plane dove so hard that the Kindle lying on my lap (I’m halfway through <a href="https://jamesclear.com/book-summaries/mastery">Mastery by George Leonard</a>, thanks Leif for the recommendation!) flew up into the air, made a slow-motion arc and came crashing down on the floor.</li>
<li>It was at this point that a large number of passengers involuntarily panic-shouted, adding to the atmosphere.</li>
<li>I myself could not show any external signs of fear, primarily because I needed to comfort GOU#1, who sat next to me, and is now old enough to appreciate the potential risks of the situation we found ourselves in, but also because I had to fit in my behaviour with the narrative that YOU SIMPLY HAVE TO TRUST THE ENGINEERS.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>During our time away, these puppies had finally made their way through customs ($115 in total for <a href="https://lunasandals.com/products/mono-2-0">Luna Mono 2.0 sandals</a> + <a href="https://lunasandals.com/products/polar-fleece-tabi-socks">tabi socks</a>, $66 SA import duties ouch):</li>

<p>Yes friends, they are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huarache_(running_shoe)">Huarache-style running sandals</a>, in which you go running.</p>
<p>My friend <a href="http://mentat.za.net/">Stéfan</a> sent me a message on <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> shortly after <a href="/2018/03/04/weekly-head-voices-134/">WHV #134</a>, but before I had even <a href="/2018/04/02/weekly-head-voices-138-born-to-run/#the-running-people">started reading Born to Run</a>.</p>
<p>Besides sporting best-in-class encryption, his message was suavely convincing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Charl, let me bring you a pair of the magical sandals that I run in.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was not able to purge the thought of running free like that.</p>
<p>When I finally realised that it was only a question of time, I decided not to wait any longer than necessary, and ordered them directly.</p>
<p>This morning I started with a short run, just to see what it was like, and to start acclimatising.</p>
<p>It was exactly like I had been dreaming for the past two nights.</p>
<p>Time will have to tell, but at this very moment, I’m not sure if I’ll want to run in normal running shoes again.</p>

We spent the first week of July about 100km to the south of Durban.
It was an epic winter break-away with the conditions so summery that we forgot that it’s technically speaking the middle of winter. Down to the beach every day, balmy evenings spent outside, brilliant runs through the KwaZulu-Natal hills and a holiday destination that has mastered the arts of happy-children-happy-parental-units all contributed to a brilliant week.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>This edition of the Weekly Head Voices is a retrospective of the period from Monday June 26 to Sunday July 30, where with <em>weekly</em> I mean <em>regular(ish)</em>, which is still better than <em>absent</em>. :)</p>

<p>On the way back to the airport, we squeezed in a visit to uShaka Marine World, where we visited the dolphins, the aquarium and I joined the two oldest genetic offspring units <a href="https://www.chimpandzee.co.za/ushaka/">zip-lining all over the water park</a>.</p>

<p>The week after it was off to The Hague for mostly work and a few maximally cromulent social sessions with my besties.</p>
<p>Plans were made. Philosophical discussions were had. Fortunately, no planes were missed.</p>
<p>During all of this, <a href="http://openserve.co.za/open/">OpenServe’s elves</a> were busy digging up my neighbourhood installing these magical green <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_of_tubes">tubes</a> everywhere. They’re magical because soon they will be filled with super thin glass fiber, and then lit up with lovely lovely internet.</p>
<p>I really can’t wait.</p>

<p>On the evening before taking chances but not missing my flight home, the conversation spent a good amount of time on the topics of happiness, contentment and life goals.</p>
<p>As a reader of this blog, you will know by now that we’re not big fans of happiness. See the last bit of <a href="/2011/04/07/happinessexception-weekly-head-voices-44/">Weekly Head Voices #44</a> (6+ years ago…) which has what I think is a good summary of why we are not.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we have always thought that <em>contentment</em> is perhaps a more practical state to try and work towards.</p>
<p>There are however those who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/17/psychology-happiness-contentment-humans-aspire-goals-accomplish-evolution">make the logical argument</a> that contentment has been evolved out of us a long time ago, and that we are thus doomed never to find contentment for more than a few moments.</p>
<p>In <a href="/2012/01/28/slow-philosophy-weekly-head-voices-64/">WHV #64</a>, following an old tradition of hiding backyard philosophy in arb blog posts, I suggested side-stepping the issue by not focusing on life goals, which are in essence a sort of end point which will invariably lead to post-achievement ennui, but instead focusing on setting and following a certain direction.</p>
<p>Life directions don’t have to have endpoints, but they can have waypoints. The difference is that you know that these are waypoints, and you accept that the journey continues until it finally stops forever.</p>
<p>Whatever the case may be, the conversation motivated me to start a new search for more scientifically-oriented literature on the topics of human happiness, contentment, life goals and so forth.</p>
<p>Up to now my search has not turned up very much. In a surprising turn of events, it seems that there is no shortage of people who are willing to sell you the literature-equivalent of snake-oil, in some cases knowingly but in most cases utterly oblivious.</p>
<p>Somewhere else during this same evening (it was a productive night), we provisionally added a third rule to the <em>WHV’s Two Rules for Achieving Great Success in Life, or Just Surviving, Whichever Comes First</em>.</p>
<p>The rules are now: 1. Be useful. 2. Be likeable. 3. Evolve.</p>
<p>I have been using rules 1 and 2 of the hitherto bi-ruled WHV’s TRAGSL-JS-WCF (pronounced TRAGSL-JS-WCF) as a central component in my GOUs education.</p>
<p>Rule 3 should be understood as actively and continuously upgrading oneself based on continuous introspection and retrospection.</p>
<p>I was initially hesitant to add a third rule to the previously perfect two-rule combo, but wise friend made good arguments for reminding system users of the important of deliberate and continuous self-improvement.</p>
<p>In 25 years I hope to be able to report back on the efficacy of this system based on a smallish but long-term study with N=3.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
