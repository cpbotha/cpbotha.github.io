<p>The book consists of seven and a half beautifully written and amazing stories
about the human brain.</p>
<p>If you have any interest in how humans work, or in brains (and who doesn&rsquo;t?!),
and you like good stories, please purchase and read this book.</p>
<p>In the meantime, you can apply that amazing, ever-evolving, never-sleeping
chunk of information processing tissue in your skull to ingest the concepts
encoded by the words below!</p>
<h2 id="your-brain-is-not-for-thinking">Your Brain Is Not for Thinking</h2>
<p>The main reason or motivation for the evolution of the brain was not such much
the ability to think, which is admittedly an entertaining side-effect, but
rather the efficient running of the <em>body budget</em>.</p>
<p>Feldman Barrett writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A budget for your body similarly tracks resources like water, salt, and glucose
as you gain and lose them. Each action that spends resources, such as swimming
or running, is like a withdrawal from your account. Actions that replenish your
resources, such as eating and sleeping, are like deposits</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Body budgeting</em>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allostasis">allostatis</a>, refers to the idea that organisms continuously
and automatically <em>predict</em> the body&rsquo;s needs <em>before</em> they arise.</p>
<p>For the human body with all of its complexity, it&rsquo;s clear to see that
accurately predicting needs and expenditures before they arise can become
tricky, and might just require that big brain after all.</p>
<p>It becomes especially interesting when you remember that our complex social
embedding and interactions form a crucial part of our survival.</p>
<p>In other words, we&rsquo;re not just predicting the direct physical needs of our own
bodies, but a whole network of interwoven social interactions and
relationships, the effects of our actions and those of others on everyone in
that network, and the possible future implications for our requirements and
expenditures.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to need that supercomputer.</p>
<h2 id="you-have-one-brain">You Have One Brain (Not Three)</h2>
<p>Just like it is to me, I&rsquo;m sure that the idea of the triune brain, that is the
idea that the humain brain consists of three &ldquo;layers&rdquo;, namely the most
primitive &ldquo;lizard&rdquo; brain, focused on survival, the slightly more modern limbic
system for emotion on top of that and finally the neocortex, the rational part
that differentiates humans from other animals and that includes the prefrontal
cortex, is quite familiar to you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear that Feldman Barrett experiences considerable mirth when she gets to
shatter that familiar mental model for everyone reading her book.</p>
<p>After some unravelling of assumptions, she writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The triune brain idea is one of the most successful and widespread errors in
all of science. It&rsquo;s certainly a compelling story, and at times, it captures
how we feel in daily life.</p>
<p>[some text omitted]</p>
<p>But human brains don&rsquo;t work that way. Bad behavior doesn&rsquo;t come from ancient
and unbridled inner beasts. Good behavior is not the result of rationality. And
rationality and emotion are not at war . . . they do not even live in separate
parts of the brain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A bit further on, we learn that the brains of all mammals, and possibly the
brains of reptiles and other vertebrates, are &ldquo;built from a single
manufacturing plan&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In other words, in typical lazy (or efficient) Mother Nature fashion, maximal
reuse is at play here, and we&rsquo;re not special. (phew)</p>
<p>The brains follow the same manufacturing process, with the same stages in the
same order, but the stages do run for different durations depending on the
species.</p>
<p>To further ram that point home:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So the human brain has no new parts. The neurons in your brain can be found in
the brains of other mammals and, likely, other vertebrates. This discovery
undermines the evolutionary foundations of the triune brain story.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As an&hellip; erstwhile fan of pre-frontal cortex (PFC) explanations, I felt quite
directly addressed by her final assertion that it was really time to let the
triune brain go now:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anything you read or hear that proclaims the human neocortex, cerebral cortex,
or prefrontal cortex to be the root of rationality, or says that the frontal
lobe regulates so-called emotional brain areas to keep irrational behavior in
check, is simply outdated or woefully incomplete. The triune brain idea and its
epic battle between emotion, instinct, and rationality is a modern myth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The 1.5th lesson is concluded with some great advice for the future:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have one brain, not three. To move past Plato&rsquo;s ancient battle, we might
need to fundamentally rethink what it means to be rational, what it means to be
responsible for our actions, and perhaps even what it means to be human.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="your-brain-is-a-network">Your Brain Is a Network</h2>
<p>(I already had some knowledge of the brain network, but this lesson surprised
me with new knowledge on every page!)</p>
<p>Your brain is a network of 128 billion (that&rsquo;s 128 thousand million, or 128 x
10<sup>9</sup>) interconnected neurons.</p>
<p>There are very many connections&hellip;</p>
<p>How many?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each neuron directly passes information to just a few thousand other neurons
and receives information from a few thousand others, give or take, yielding
over five hundred trillion neuron-to-neuron connections.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Five hundred trillion means five hundred million million, or 500 x 10<sup>12</sup>.</p>
<p>If you went and connected each neuron with every other neuron, there would be
many more connections than this, but that would be far too expensive,
energy-wise.</p>
<p>Instead, the brain is connected just well enough to do its amazing job, in a
superbly energy-efficient way.</p>
<p>The next lesson that struck me was this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your brain network is always on. Your neurons never just sit around waiting for
something in the outside world to make them fire. Instead, all of your neurons
chat constantly with one another through their wiring. Their communications may
become stronger or weaker depending on what&rsquo;s happening in the world and in
your body, but the conversation never stops until you die.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty crazy to think (haha) that all of those connections are firing, all
the damn time.</p>
<p>It never stops, until you die.</p>
<h3 id="a-network-of-clustered-neurons-some-clusters-acting-as-long-distance-hubs">A network of clustered neurons, some clusters acting as long-distance hubs</h3>
<p>Getting back to the observation that the brain is not fully connected, but
rather sparsely so, a good next question would be &ldquo;but how exactly is it
sparsely connected?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Feldman Barrett has a crystal clear explanation of the modular
structure of the brain:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your brain network is organized in much the same way [as the network of
airports]. Its neurons are grouped into clusters that are like airports. Most
of the connections in and out of a cluster are local, so, like an airport, the
cluster serves mostly local traffic. In addition, some clusters serve as hubs
for communication. They are densely connected to many other clusters, and some
of their axons reach far across the brain and act as long-distance
connections. Brain hubs, like airport hubs, make a complicated system
efficient. They allow most neurons to participate globally even as they focus
more locally. Hubs form the backbone of communication throughout the brain</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To the best of our (where with &ldquo;our&rdquo;, I mean &ldquo;science&rsquo;s&rdquo;) knowledge, this kind
of network gives the most bang for your energy buck. It&rsquo;s extremely powerful,
yet efficient and as an added bonus actually fits into your skull.</p>
<p>I also found it interesting to read that damage to the hub clusters
specifically was associated with a number of neurological disorders, such as
depression, schizophrenia, dyslexia, chronic pain, dementia and Parkinson&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Just as would be the case with an airport network, if the airport hubs were
damaged, that would have far-reacing effects on the whole system.</p>
<h3 id="the-network-is-bathed-in-chemicals-called-neurotransmitters">The network is bathed in chemicals called neurotransmitters</h3>
<p>Each tiny neuron continuously fires its electrical signal out through its axon
into possibly thousands of downstream neurons.</p>
<p>The gap between the firing axon and the receiving neuron&rsquo;s dendrite is called a
synapse.</p>
<p>To add some more variability and flexibility to the already complex network,
the whole thing is bathed in neurotransmitters which either help or hinder that
firing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your brain wiring is bathed in chemicals that complete the local connections
between neurons. These chemicals, such as glutamate, serotonin, and dopamine,
are called neurotransmitters, and they make it easier or harder for signals to
pass across synapses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps because that wasn&rsquo;t already interesting enough, a subset of these
chemicals, notably serotonin and dopamine, can boost or diminish the effect of
other neurotransmitters, and can therefore be called <em>neuromodulators</em>.</p>
<h3 id="neurons-can-do-different-tasks-the-same-task-can-be-done-by-different-neurons">Neurons can do different tasks, the same task can be done by different neurons</h3>
<p>The common perception that each brain region is responsible for a specific task
is incorrect. Groups of neurons are indeed more likely to perform a specific
task, but there are many examples of such groups participating in various other
tasks.</p>
<p>Similarly, the same task can easily be performed by different sets of neurons,
a phenomenon called <em>degeneracy</em>.</p>
<p>Feldman Barrett notes that even reaching for the exact same thing twice in a
row will engage different sets of neurons.</p>
<h3 id="slow-to-fast-changes-complexity-is-key-in-dealing-with-our-reality">Slow to fast changes, complexity is key in dealing with our reality</h3>
<p>I really liked the explanation of how the brain adapts to the world at
different speeds:</p>
<ul>
<li>Slow changes by learning / rewiring connections / plasticity.</li>
<li>Faster changes by neurotransmitters and neuromodulators.</li>
<li>Neurons performing multiple jobs.</li>
</ul>
<p>The network needs to be this complex because:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip; your brain can create massive numbers of different patterns by combining
bits and pieces of old patterns it has made before. The result is a brain that
runs its body efficiently in a world full of constantly changing situations by
recalling patterns that helped in the past and generating new ones to try.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&hellip; and then further down, this intriguing observation on memories not being
stored, but being reconstructed on demand:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brains of higher complexity can remember more. A brain doesn&rsquo;t store memories
like files in a computer—it reconstructs them on demand with electricity and
swirling chemicals. We call this process remembering but it&rsquo;s really
assembling. A complex brain can assemble many more memories than either
Meatloaf Brain or Pocketknife Brain could. And each time you have the same
memory, your brain may have assembled it with a different collection of
neurons.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This lesson is wrapped up with the mind-expanding (haha) realization that the
brain encompasses more than just the neurons in your head:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your brain is more than just neurons. It includes blood vessels and various
fluids that I haven&rsquo;t talked about. It also includes other kinds of brain
cells, called glial cells, that function in ways that scientists don&rsquo;t fully
understand yet. Your brain network may even extend, surprisingly, into your gut
and intestines, where scientists have found microbes that communicate with your
brain via neuro-transmitters.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="little-brains-wire-themselves-to-their-world">Little Brains Wire Themselves to Their World</h2>
<p>Please note, teenagers and other young adults, your brain is only fully formed
when you reach the ripe old age of 25!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip; little human brains are born under construction. They don&rsquo;t take on their
full adult structure and function until they finish their principal wiring, a
process that takes about twenty-five years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This has interesting and far-reaching consequences for the best approach to
work with younger humans. They might walk like adults and talk like adults,
when in fact they still need a few years of brain maturation before being fully
responsible.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the record for humans older than 25 is also not that
impressive.</p>
<p>Half-jokes aside, it is fascinating and quite terrifying to read how much a
human child is, often irrevocably, formed by its environment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To a remarkable extent, a baby&rsquo;s genes are guided and regulated by the
surrounding environment. The brain areas that are most centrally involved in
vision, for example, develop normally after birth only if a baby&rsquo;s retinas are
regularly exposed to light. An infant&rsquo;s brain also learns to locate sounds in
the world based on the specific shape of the baby&rsquo;s ear. To make matters even
stranger, a baby&rsquo;s body requires some additional genes that sneak in from the
outside world. These tiny visitors travel inside of bacteria and other critters
and affect the brain in ways that scientists are only beginning to understand</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot more later, but this is a good introduction of the idea that our
brains, our very identities, are so intertwined with the external world, and
especially so when we are small and quite helpless.</p>
<p>Parents <em>really</em> need to do their utmost best.</p>
<p>The child&rsquo;s brain develops into its adult complexity via two processes called
<em>tuning</em> and <em>pruning</em>.</p>
<p><em>Tuning</em> means that neural connections that are used often become stronger. At
a cellular level this happens through the myelin sheaths around axons (the
neurons output) becoming thicker, facilitating signal transmission, and also
through the dendrites (the inputs) becoming bushier.</p>
<p><em>Pruning</em> means that neural connections that are not really used weaken and
disappear. Here Feldman Barrett invokes one of my favourite principles when
trying to understand the ruthless efficiency in human physiology: <a href="https://cpbotha.net/2020/12/23/weekly-head-voices-212-use-it-or-lose-it/#use-it-or-lose-it">Use it or
lose it</a>.</p>
<p>In the case of the developing child, it starts with far more neurons than an
adult brain needs. This is great for a brain that will need to adapt to a range
of new situations. However, once the situation is known, the unused neurons and
connections are ruthlessly pruned away to result eventually in a more efficient
brain.</p>
<p>Feldman Barrett proceeds to give a number of compelling examples how the baby&rsquo;s
caretakers and the environment that they create play an absolutely crucial role
in the <em>physical</em> development of the new neural network.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Little brains require a social world in order to develop typically. You&rsquo;ve
already learned that babies need certain physical inputs, such as photons of
light bombarding their retinas, or their brains will never develop normal
vision. It turns out that they also need social inputs from other humans who
guide their attention, speak or sing to them, and cuddle them at key
moments. If these needs aren&rsquo;t met, things can go terribly wrong.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She then discusses a horrible example where thousands of Romanian babies found
themselves in orphanages in the 1960s due to terrible leadership decisions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In some orphanages, babies were warehoused in rows of cribs, with little
stimulation or social interaction. Nurses or caregivers would come in and feed
them, change them, and put them back in the cribs. That was about it.</p>
<p>[text ommitted]</p>
<p>As a consequence of this social neglect, the Romanian orphans grew up
intellectually impaired. They had problems learning language. They had
difficulty concentrating and resisting distractions, probably because nobody
had shared attention with them, so their brains never developed the wiring for
an effective spotlight. They also had trouble controlling themselves. Alongside
the children&rsquo;s mental and behavioral issues, their bodies were stunted, most
likely because they grew up without caregivers to keep their body budgets
solvent. This meant their brains never learned to budget effectively. A little
brain wires itself to its environment, and when that environment is missing key
elements for healthy body budgeting, critical brain wiring can be pruned away.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Based on this and far too many other observations, it is clear that children
absolutely need to be well cared for, both physically and socially, in order to
have a chance to develop into healthy adults.</p>
<p>This is a fundamental mechanism that can&rsquo;t be easily remedied later.</p>
<p>She continues with this line of discussion into the now even more relevant
poverty cycle phenomenon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Research shows that early and long exposure to poverty is bad for the
developing brain. Inadequate nutrition, interrupted sleep due to street noise,
poor temperature regulation due to lack of heat or ventilation, and other
circumstances of poverty may alter the development of the front of the cerebral
cortex, namely the prefrontal cortex. This brain area is involved in a range of
critical functions, including attention, language, and body
budgeting. Scientists are still studying the ways that poverty affects brain
development, but we do know that it&rsquo;s linked to poorer performance in school
and fewer years of education. These burdens ultimately increase a child&rsquo;s risk
of living in poverty when he grows up and has children of his own</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, this lesson is wrapped up with the observation that nature and nurture
are deeply and intricately intertwined:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When it comes to the brain, simple distinctions like nature versus nurture are
alluring but not realistic. We have the kind of nature that <em>requires</em>
nurture. Your genes require a physical and social environment &ndash; a niche filled
with other humans who shared your infant gaze, spoke to you with intent, set
your sleep schedule, and controlled your body temperature &ndash; in order to
produce a finished brain</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="your-brain-predicts--almost--everything-you-do">Your Brain Predicts (Almost) Everything You Do</h2>
<p>Readers of my personal blog might remember <a href="https://cpbotha.net/2019/07/25/weekly-head-voices-174-i-row-row-row-your-boat/#life-is-but-a-dream">my story in 2019 about the brain
being stuck in the dark bony cage we call &ldquo;skull&rdquo;</a>, taking fairly limited
sensory inputs, and in actual fact dreaming up all of one&rsquo;s reality on demand,
a story <a href="https://cpbotha.net/2019/10/07/weekly-head-voices-180-ensembleyou-and-the-describers/#the-describers">I later found out was also called transcendental idealism</a>.</p>
<p>At the start of lesson 4, Feldman Barrett writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scientists used to believe that the brain’s visual system operated sort of like
a camera, detecting the visual information “out there” in the world and
constructing a photograph-like image in the mind. Today we know better. Your
view of the world is no photograph. It’s a construction of your brain that is
so fluid and so convincing that it appears to be accurate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&hellip; and then comes the brain stuck in a box story again!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the moment you’re born to the moment you draw your last breath, your brain
is stuck in a dark, silent box called your skull. Day in and day out, it
continually receives sense data from the outside world via your eyes, ears,
nose, and other sensory organs. This data does not arrive in the form of the
meaningful sights, smells, sounds, and other sensations that most of us
experience. It’s just a barrage of light waves, chemicals, and changes in air
pressure with no inherent significance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most probably I picked this up somewhere on the echoing internet waves. Lex
Fridman podcast would be my bet, but not <a href="https://lexfridman.com/lisa-feldman-barrett/">the Feldman Barrett episode</a> because
that only came out in October of 2020.</p>
<p>However, this lesson is not only about your brain being stuck in a box, but the
observation that your brain is constantly predicting what&rsquo;s going to happen
next.</p>
<p>This is perhaps even more extreme than you might guess.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What happens next still astounds me, even as a neuroscientist. If your brain
has predicted well, then your neurons are already firing in a pattern that
matches the incoming sense data. That means this sense data itself has no
further use beyond confirming your brain’s predictions. What you see, hear,
smell, and taste in the world and feel in your body in that moment are
completely constructed in your head. By prediction, your brain has efficiently
prepared you to act.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So yes, it seems we are mostly all in fact dreaming together in a highly
synchronized fashion.</p>
<h2 id="your-brain-secretly-works-with-other-brains">Your Brain Secretly Works with Other Brains</h2>
<p>This aspect fascinated me during the podcast with Lex Fridman:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part of being a social species, it turns out, is that we regulate one another&rsquo;s
body budgets &ndash; the ways in which our brains manage the bodily resources we use
every day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As if it wasn&rsquo;t already trick enough that we regulate our own body budgets, we
also have a profound effect on each other&rsquo;s body budgets, an effect that we
ideally put to good use for positive regulation.</p>
<p>The stress that we often experience due to interaction with our fellow humans
plays a prominent role in this lesson.</p>
<p>In the workplace, having great colleagues that you can trust will leave more
energy to do your work better:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When people work in an environment where they can learn to trust one another,
they&rsquo;ll have less burden on their body budgets, saving resources that can be
invested in new ideas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Profoundly, but probably not surprisingly, our prediction machines have a much
easier time modelling humans that are similar to us, and conversely a much more
difficult time working with fellow humans that are different from us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you have empathy for other people, your brain predicts what they&rsquo;ll think
and feel and do. The more familiar the other people are to you, the more
efficiently your brain predicts their inner struggles. The whole process feels
obvious and natural, as if you were reading another person&rsquo;s mind. But there&rsquo;s
a catch—when people are less familiar to you, it can be harder to
empathize. You might have to learn more about the person, an extra effort that
translates into more withdrawals from your body budget, which can feel
unpleasant. This may be one reason why people sometimes fail to empathize with
those who look different or believe different things than they do and why it
can feel uncomfortable to try. It&rsquo;s metabolically costly for a brain to deal
with things that are hard to predict.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This only underlines the fact that we really have no choice but to put in the
best effort that we can to support and cultivate more diversity.</p>
<p>Like in many other situations, mother nature can&rsquo;t be trusted here either, so
we have to apply our humanity to make up for her failings.</p>
<p>Next Feldman Barrett discusses the central role of speech also in how we
regulate each other&rsquo;s stress levels:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Primates like monkeys and chimpanzees also use vision to regulate each other&rsquo;s
nervous systems. Humans are unique in the animal kingdom, however, because we
also regulate each other with words. A kind word may calm you, as when a friend
gives you a compliment at the end of a hard day. A hateful word from a bully
may cause your brain to predict threat and flood your bloodstream with
hormones, squandering precious resources from your body budget.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is of course accurate and makes complete sense to me, but I have never
thought about it in these explicit co-regulation terms.</p>
<p>What follows is an important warning that it really does not matter what the
source of the stress is, if it continues, it will all pile up over time and it
will harm you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to understand that the human brain doesn&rsquo;t seem to distinguish
between different sources of chronic stress. If your body budget is already
depleted by the circumstances of life—like physical illness, financial
hardship, hormone surges, or simply not sleeping or exercising enough—your
brain becomes more vulnerable to stress of all kinds. This includes the
biological effects of words designed to threaten, bully, or torment you or
people you care about. When your body budget is continually burdened, momentary
stressors pile up, even the kind that you&rsquo;d normally bounce back from
quickly. It&rsquo;s like children jumping on a bed. The bed might withstand ten kids
bouncing at the same time, but the eleventh one snaps the bed frame.  Simply
put, a long period of chronic stress can harm a human brain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, contrary to the popular idiom, the wrong sorts of words <em>can</em> and
<em>will</em> cause bodily harm:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re exposed to verbal nastiness continually for months and months or
if you live in an environment that persistently and relentlessly taxes your
body budget, words can indeed physically injure your brain. Not because you&rsquo;re
weak or a so-called snowflake, but because you&rsquo;re a human. Your nervous system
is bound up with the behavior of other humans, for better or for worse. You can
argue what the data means or if it&rsquo;s important, but it is what it is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She explains that when you&rsquo;re exposed to social stress within two hours from a
meal, you even metabolize the foods from that meal much worse than you normally
would.</p>
<p>She summarises the whole idea with the following observation, and perhaps this
is that one thing we should take home with us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The best thing for your nervous system is another human. The worst thing for
your nervous system is also another human</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="our-interconnectedness-and-our-personal-freedom">Our interconnectedness and our personal freedom</h3>
<p>Feldman Barrett has an extremeley timely piece at the end of this chapter
about how our inescapable (and fantastic) interconnectedness has significant
implications for our personal freedoms.</p>
<p>First, she makes clear how deeply we have always affected each other, and how
inescapable this is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After all, history is filled with examples of overcoming our biology so we can
live our values. Other people carry germs, for example, that can make us sick
or even kill us, but only in the most nightmarish cases do we legislate a
solution that restricts our personal freedoms. More commonly, we cooperate and
innovate. We invent soap, we bump elbows instead of shaking hands, we search
for new medicines and vaccines, and so on. If this is insufficient, experts
tell us we&rsquo;re supposed to voluntarily isolate ourselves and practice social
distancing. Even in a free society, our actions affect one another in ways that
are, like viruses, often invisible to us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&hellip; and then she completes this train of reasoning with the observation that
personal freedom does have a great associated cost which is often exacted from
others:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scientists are often asked to make their research useful to everyday
life. These scientific findings about words, chronic stress, and disease are a
perfect example. There is a real biological benefit when people treat one
another with basic human dignity. And if we don&rsquo;t, there is also a real
biological consequence, and it eventually trickles down to a financial and
social cost for everyone. The price of personal freedom is personal
responsibility for your impact on others. The wiring of all of our brains
guarantees it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is clear that personal freedom has to be balanced carefully with cost to
others, where the latter does have precedence.</p>
<h2 id="brains-make-more-than-one-kind-of-mind">Brains Make More than One Kind of Mind</h2>
<p>She starts this chapter about the sometimes large differences differences
between humans with the great example that people from Bali in Indonesia <em>fall
asleep when they are very afraid</em>, while most Western folks are more likely to
freeze on the spot, eyes wide, and gasp.</p>
<p>Perhaps even more fundamental than that, those same folks who grep up in Bali,
or in the Illongot culture in the Philippines, don&rsquo;t experience <em>thinking</em> and
<em>feeling</em> as two separate concepts, like most Westerners do, but rather as a
single thing.</p>
<p>She has more examples like this, but her overarching statement is that the same
physical brain can produce and house quite different <em>minds</em>.</p>
<p>Importantly, variation is the norm.</p>
<p>Physical brains do have many common features, but minds by definition less so,
because of the great adaptability of the underlying physical brains.</p>
<p>She gives another example pointing out that the Western idea of the body and
mind as separate interacting constructs is also not the norm:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brains have a lot of common features; minds, less so, because minds depend in
part on micro-wiring that is tuned and pruned by culture. For example, many
Western cultures draw strong dividing lines between the mental and the
physical. If your stomach hurts, you&rsquo;re likely to visit your primary care
physician or a gastroenterologist; if you’re feeling anxiety, you&rsquo;re more
likely to see a psychologist, even if the symptoms and the underlying causes
are identical. But in some Eastern cultures, such as those that practice
Buddhism, mind and body are much more integrated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As an aside, with all the work that is currently happening on the microbiome,
showing how bacteria in your gut can and do affect your mood and personality,
it is starting to look like the body-and-mind-in-one perspective could be
closer to reality.</p>
<p>I highlighted the following paragraph, because (as an engineer and a data
person) I found it an intriguing idea that your brain is summarising in
real-time, down to a single metric called &ldquo;affect&rdquo;, the storm of external and
internal data that it has to deal with.</p>
<p>In other words, <em>affect</em> is a single metric, or rather feeling, that summarises
the complete state of your whole system.</p>
<p>Feldman Barrett writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where does affect come from? In every moment &ndash; like right now, as you read
these words &ndash; your hormones, organs, and immune system are producing a storm
of sense data, and you&rsquo;re barely aware of it. You notice your heartbeat and
breathing only when they&rsquo;re intense or you focus on them. You almost never
notice your body temperature unless it&rsquo;s too high or too low. Your brain,
however, makes meaning from this data storm continuously to predict your body’s
next action and meet its metabolic needs before they arise. In the midst of all
this activity inside you, something miraculous happens. Your brain summarizes
what&rsquo;s going on with your body in the moment, and you feel that summary as
affect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, for better or for worse, it is possible to modify your mind with
chemicals or with experiences:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can modify your mind. People do this all the time. College students use
caffeine or amphetamines to create minds that can pull an all-nighter before a
final exam. Partygoers drink alcohol to create minds that are more relaxed and
less inhibited in social situations (and miraculously, other people around them
suddenly become much more attractive). These chemical modifications last for
only a short time. For longer-lasting modifications, you can try new
experiences or learn new things to rewire your brain, as we discussed in
earlier lessons.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She mentions that one of the most challenging experiences in terms of changing
your mind is moving to another culture.</p>
<p>The lesson is concluded with the following re-iteration of its central point,
the malleability of the mind:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When it comes to human minds, variation is the norm, and what we call &ldquo;human
nature&rdquo; is really many human natures. We don&rsquo;t need one universal mind in order
to claim that we are all one species. All we need is an exceptionally complex
brain that wires itself to its physical and social surroundings.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="our-brains-can-create-reality">Our Brains Can Create Reality</h2>
<p>This is such an amazing chapter, which I really hope that you are able to read
in its full form.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, here I&rsquo;ll try to summarise the main gist.</p>
<p>Humans have the unique ability to create <em>social reality</em>.</p>
<p>The country that you live in, its name, the exact border surrounding it, the
customs and the laws that you share with your fellow citizens, the right way to
act at a party, and so on&hellip;</p>
<p>All of that was <em>synthesized</em>, created out of nothing, by a bunch of human
minds.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we have demonstrated in many cases that we are able to keep these
social realities operational for thousands of years.</p>
<p>Scientists do not know for sure how our brains developed this capability, but
they suspect it is based on what Feldman Barrett calls the Five Cs:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Creativity</dt>
<dd>We are able to draw a border and then invent a country with a
national identity and a bunch of rules.</dd>
<dt>Communication</dt>
<dd>Millions of brains are subsequently able to communicate our
new country and its rules to each other, and to keep each other up to date.</dd>
<dt>Copying</dt>
<dd>Our children learn how to operate by copying us. Similarly, we
learn form each other by copying behaviour.</dd>
<dt>Cooperation</dt>
<dd>We cooperate on a geographical scale. The book quite casually
mentions the example of food distribution, all the way from farms anywhere on
the globe onto your plate for dinner.</dd>
<dt>Compression</dt>
<dd>This concept definitely needs a bit more space, so I&rsquo;ll
continue in the text below.</dd>
</dl>
<p>You&rsquo;ll recall from a previous lesson that <a href="#your-brain-is-a-network">your brain is a (giant) network</a>.</p>
<p>What was not emphasised in that lesson (or my notes), is the massive
abstraction capability inherent in our brain architectures.</p>
<p>There are millions of neurons bringing in signals from the photosensitive
receptors in your retina. After a few centimetres, those neural pathways
connect <em>in groups</em> to summarising neurons, which combine each group&rsquo;s
information into a single signal.</p>
<p>All of those summarising neurons output into yet another layer of
well-connected summarising neurons.</p>
<p>This process of successive summarisation continues all the way into the front
of your brain, which contains the highest level of summarisation, that is, the
fewest number of mega-neurons that aggregate effectively massive amounts of
information from all of the lower levels indirectly feeding into them.</p>
<p>I hope that it is obvious now why this successive summarisation is also
referred to as <em>compression</em>.</p>
<p>So what does this <em>compression</em> buy us humans?</p>
<p>This extreme level of compression enables us to <em>think
abstractly</em>. Abstraction, together with the rest of the Five Cs enables us to
create and maintain social reality.</p>
<p>Feldman Barrett wraps it up like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The wiring of your cerebral cortex makes compression possible. Compression
enables sensory integration. Sensory integration enables
abstraction. Abstraction permits your highly complex brain to issue flexible
predictions based on the functions of things rather than on their physical
form. That is creativity. And you can share these predictions by way of
communication, cooperation, and copying. That is how the Five Cs empower a
human brain to create and share social reality</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No other animal brain can achieve the extreme levels of compression and
abstraction required to create social reality.</p>
<p>As if this chapter in the book was not amazing enough, Feldman Barrett
discusses the benefits and disadvantages of our reality creation superpower.</p>
<p>As an example of the disadvantages, I strongly agree with her view on our often
stupid fascination with boxes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, humans vary tremendously, like every animal species does. But
unlike the rest of the animal kingdom, we organize some of this variation into
little boxes with labels such as race, gender, and nationality. We treat the
labeled boxes as if they&rsquo;re part of nature when in fact we build them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would like to conclude this section with a part of the book&rsquo;s conclusion to
this inspiring chapter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Social reality is a superpower that emerges from an ensemble of human
brains. It gives us the possibility to chart our own destiny and even influence
the evolution of our species. We can make up abstract concepts, share them,
weave them into a reality, and conquer just about any environment &ndash; natural,
political, or social &ndash; as long as we work together. We have more control over
reality than we might think. We also have more responsibility for reality than
we might realize.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="a-summary-of-the-summary">A summary of the summary</h2>
<p>For those of you that have no time to read the book or even these book notes,
Feldman Barrett has a super compact summary of her seven and a half lessons in
the epilogue.</p>
<p>The human brain is:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A brain that constructs such rich mental experiences that we feel like
emotion and reason wrestle inside us</li>
<li>A brain that&rsquo;s so complex that we describe it by metaphors and mistake them
for knowledge</li>
<li>A brain that&rsquo;s so skilled at rewiring itself that we think we&rsquo;re born with
all sorts of things that we actually learn</li>
<li>A brain that&rsquo;s so effective at hallucinating that we believe we see the world
objectively, and so fast at predicting that we mistake our movements for
reactions</li>
<li>A brain that regulates other brains so invisibly that we presume we&rsquo;re
independent of each other</li>
<li>A brain that creates so many kinds of minds that we assume there&rsquo;s a single
human nature to explain them all</li>
<li>A brain that&rsquo;s so good at believing its own inventions that we mistake social
reality for the natural world</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="my-advent-of-code-comes-to-an-end">My Advent of Code comes to an end</h2>
<p>You might remember from <a href="/2020/12/12/weekly-head-voices-211-table-mountain-run-ish/#advent-of-code-2020">WHV #211 that I was really enjoying the Advent of Code 2020</a>.</p>
<p>As I hinted there, I was happy to reach my modest goal of the double digits (i.e. day 10).</p>
<p>On day 20 however (which is of course December 20), the puzzle took up so much
of my time that I decided, with significant difficulty (remember these puzzles
are like cat nip for nerds), to drop out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been great fun, and I learned so much <a href="https://nim-lang.org/">nim</a> in such a short period, but at
some point one has to make the call whether the time cost is justified by the
fun and the learning.</p>
<p>P.S. It took about two days to finally let go. :)</p>
<h2 id="use-it-or-lose-it">Use it, or lose it</h2>
<p>I am currently reading the fascinating book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51778153-livewired"><em>Livewired: The Inside Story of the
Ever-Changing Brain</em></a> by neuro-scientist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David%5FEagleman">David Eagleman</a>.</p>
<p>As you can probably deduce from the title, this book is about how the brain
never stops rewiring itself.</p>
<p>Even now as you&rsquo;re reading these words, your brain is making and breaking
connections, and changing chemical balances, as it crunches through and
sometimes integrates the ideas that are invoked by this weird trick we humans
do, called <em>speech</em>, and the even weirder trick, called <em>writing</em>.</p>
<p>(Writing: Your retinae count the photons coming from the screen on which you&rsquo;re
reading this, construct patterns of darkness and light, convert those patterns
to words, and then string together those words into living, breathing
simulations of reality in your giant neural network.)</p>
<p>Besides functioning as an awe-inspiring exploration of the inner workings of
the brain and the nervous system, also for me with a little bit of existing
background, the book explains the phenomenon that inside the brain there is a
never-ending struggle between brain regions, between neurons and between the
thoughts that they store.</p>
<p>If you are blindfolded for a few days, your audio cortex will start annexing
parts of your visual cortex. If you&rsquo;re blindfolded for long enough (don&rsquo;t do
this), your visual cortex could be repurposed completely.</p>
<p>Neurons compete for incoming data, memories compete for neurons; it&rsquo;s a
continual fight for existence.</p>
<p>When a new, more important or more stressful memory arrives, it can push out,
into eternal oblivion, an older, less interesting memory.</p>
<p>If an input data stream like sight or hearing stops, another strong input
stream will take over those neurons. When you stop practising long division, or
algebraic simplification, you&rsquo;ll first start to get slower, and then later lose
that ability.</p>
<p>Those neurons have been repurposed.</p>
<p>(The book posits a really interesting hypothesis for why humans dream so
visually: Your eyes are closed for a large part of the day. Your visual cortex
would take a beating every night, i.e. be taken over by other parts of your
brain, if you didn&rsquo;t use it so actively during dreaming every night.)</p>
<p>You can probably see where this is going.</p>
<p>In the brain, just like in the rest of your human physiology, efficiency is
everything.</p>
<p>The moment you stop practising a certain function, like math, or absorbing
technical documents, or programming, or driving, or running, or being kind,
your system will start to try to repurpose as much as possible of the required
subsystems for other functions that you <em>are</em> actively deploying.</p>
<p>In short: <em>Use it, or lose it.</em></p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to have to keep on practising all of the things you find important
until the day all of it stops for the last time.</p>
<p>This may seem quite harsh, but man, does it keep us honest.</p>

<p>Although it&rsquo;s grey and cold and rainy down here at the moment, I console myself
with the fact that the days are slowly but surely getting longer again, minute
by minute.</p>
<p>Starting from the depths of the Winter Solstice on June 21, when there were 9
hours and 53 minutes of daylight, today that had already stretched to a period
of 10 hours and 16 minutes.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re slowly making our way to 14 hours and 25 minutes of daylight on December
22, the Summer Solstice.</p>
<p>Although I do try to savour every moment, I can&rsquo;t help but look forward to the
warmth.</p>
<p>Anyways, the rest of this post exploded into a solid dollop of backyard
philosophy, which I hope you enjoy.</p>
<h2 id="bullet-list-of-miscellany-blom">Bullet List of Miscellany (BLoM).</h2>
<p>Before we dig in to the promised solid dollop, let&rsquo;s warm up with a BLoM.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/2019/07/17/weekly-head-voices-173-i-know/#bullet-list-of-miscellany-blom">Last week I
reported</a>
that we had half-bricked the solar inverter with a firmware upgrade. Shortly
after that, with some help from local support, we reflashed everything from
scratch (note: Although the manual says NOT to use EzFlash for GW5048-ES
inverters shipped after March, you in fact have to use EzFlash in this case)
and, lo and behold, the inverter was resurrected!
<ul>
<li>With BMS (battery management system) communication online, the system works
like a charm. Record solar consumption so far is 24.1 kWh, which is great for
winter!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>My favourite (and only) TPN (Tall Philosophical Neighbour) alerted me to the
fact that images were positively ginormous in the email version of this
blog. I&rsquo;ve fine-tuned the Hugo image-resizing shortcode to do a better job.</li>
<li>After a discussion with a friend from work about kindness, I came across this
post I wrote five (5) years ago: <a href="/2014/09/09/weekly-head-voices-81-middle-aged-zen/">Weekly Head Voices #81 - Middle-aged
zen</a>. For me it was worth
reading again. (Also, the person who wrote that seems to be more advanced
than I currently am. Life is circles.)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="life-is-but-a-dream">Life is but a dream.</h2>
<p>I would like to take you on a little trip.</p>
<p>Please imagine an extremely dark room.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re stuck in this room.</p>
<p>Fortunately there are two really small holes in the thick black walls through
which light shines in. If you get up and peak out through the holes, you can
make out what&rsquo;s going on outside of the room.</p>
<p>There are two more holes through which you can hear sounds from the outside
world, if you put your ears up to them.</p>
<p>Every day, someone shoves food in through yet another small hole.</p>
<p>At least you won&rsquo;t go hungry.</p>
<p>However, if you have to be honest, this room, your jail, is still really
dark and really lonely.</p>
<p>After some time, you discover, behind a really heavy floor tile, a number of
levers.</p>
<p>Using these levers, you are able to make the room rock to and fro.</p>
<p>After some months of practice, you learn how to rock the room more
consistently, and move it in a certain direction.</p>
<p>When you do this, the rays of light coming in through the two pinprick holes
change in interesting ways.</p>
<p>Very slowly, over a period of years, you start figuring out that the rays of
light coming in through the two holes, and the sounds coming in through the
other holes, are often caused by other prisoners, all trapped in cells similar
to yours.</p>
<p>You start making <em>contact</em>.</p>
<h3 id="real-time-reality-synthesis">Real-time reality synthesis.</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to tell this story without giving it away of course.</p>
<p>Your brain is in fact trapped in a bony cage.</p>
<p>It has two slimy nerve bundles slithering out through two holes in your
skull. The ends of those nerve bundles are sensitive to photons falling on them
(light), and send electrical signals back along their bodies when this happens.</p>
<p>Your brain has more slimy nerve bundles connected to your ears.</p>
<p>Sound waves hitting your eardrums via a chain of contact end up as vibrations
in the fluid inside your cochleae, where another set of nerve endings are
stimulated and send more electrical signals back along their bodies.</p>
<p>Your whole body is criss-crossed by more of these bundles of super long
neurons.</p>
<p>Trapped in its terribly dark bony cage, your brain is a slimy mass that absorbs
all of the electrical signals coming back from your eyes, your ears, and the
rest of your nervous system.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s really not that much coming in folks.</p>
<p>However, somehow, somewhere inside of that slimy mass, &ldquo;you&rdquo; experience all of
this as a multi-coloured, high definition, surround-sound, smell-&lsquo;o-vision,
multi-million dollar 3D Hollywood movie.</p>
<p>When I look at the imbalance between the real-time sensory data coming in on
the one hand, and the incredible richness of the experience on the other, and
bolstered slightly by what I know about the human sensory system, I come to the
conclusion that the multi-million dollar experience is a result of an almost
perpetual hallucination.</p>
<p>In other words, the reality that we experience while awake is <em>seeded</em> by our
senses, but a large part of its verdant richness is synthesised, in real-time,
by our amazing brains.</p>
<p>Thinking about it this way, it is not so surprising that we are apparently able
to synthesise whole realities while we dream, including people, environments,
conversations, relationships and experiences, all in apparent real-time.</p>
<h3 id="ps-its-the-music">P.S. It&rsquo;s the music.</h3>
<p>This whole story came up in a conversation I recently had with my partner.</p>
<p>I was trying to explain that I easily get lost in thought with the right
music.</p>
<p>Heck, when I go running (for realz), I sometimes get utterly lost in my
imagination, and it&rsquo;s quite a visual, even multi-sensory affair.</p>
<p>During that conversation, I had the insight that when this happens (i.e. I get
lost in thought), it&rsquo;s only some of the lower bandwidth sensory feeds that are
suppressed and/or slightly disrupted, for example by the right music, enabling
the super deluxe reality synthesis equipment in my brain to do what it normally
does, only slightly less constrained by outside stimuli.</p>
<p>Taking this one step further, although one might be permanently hallucinating,
one does have some control over the balance between incoming feeds and internal
simulation.</p>
<p>In <a href="/2018/02/04/weekly-head-voices-130-2-direct-experience-dopamine/#your-brain-at-work-part-2-dopamine-and-more-mindfulness">direct experience
mode</a>,
one shifts more bandwidth to the incoming feeds.</p>
<p>(Internal simulation still has to fill in the multitude of blanks.)</p>
<p>Then, when one&rsquo;s imagination takes flight, incoming feeds are turned down
somewhat, enabling internal simulation to take over.</p>

<p>I wish you an amazing week, and I look forward to when we meet again.</p>

<h1 id="the-immortality-of-lobsters">The immortality of lobsters</h1>
<p>Continuing with our watery theme, this past week I learned the very surprising fact that lobsters are <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/dont-listen-to-the-buzz-lobsters-arent-actually-immortal-88450872/"><em>sort of</em> biologically immortal</a>. In short, lobsters produce more of the enzyme telomerase than humans and other animals, which rejuvenates their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomere">telomeres</a>, which means that their cells can in theory keep on dividing forever.</p>
<p>The telomeres are the genetic bits (feeling quite punny today; nucleotides TTAGGG in vertebrates, apparently) protecting the ends of your chromosomes. Every time cells divide, the child cells have slightly shortened telomeres. At some point, the telomere becomes too short, and that line of cells can’t divide anymore.</p>
<p>This is a large part of how most animals finally die: Our cells can only divide so many times, and then the telomere ends, and then someone switches on the bright lights, and then the whole party is over.</p>
<p>However, the enzyme telomerase is able to repair telomeres, thus extending the lifetime of the organism.</p>
<p>Lobsters naturally produce so much telomerase, that their cells can keep on dividing forever. In practice, lobsters apparently only grow in size, strength and reproductive ability as they age.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, their party also eventually ends. As they grow, they have to molt their suddenly too small exoskeleton. As they get bigger, this process takes more and more energy, until the day comes that they have grown so large (<a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/dont-listen-to-the-buzz-lobsters-arent-actually-immortal-88450872/">12 kg in one instance</a>) so that the attempted molting, due to disease, is a fatal process.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, <a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2013/09/108886/lifestyle-changes-may-lengthen-telomeres-measure-cell-aging">a 2013 study</a> showed that lifestyle changes such as diet, exercise, stress reduction (including meditation) and social support, boosted telomerase activity and significantly increased telomere length in human subjects.</p>
<h1 id="your-brain-not-at-work">Your brain (not) at work</h1>
<p>On the recommendation of a colleague who is most versed in these things, I am currently reading the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Your-Brain-Work-Strategies-Distraction-ebook/dp/B002Q1YE3K/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1517170057&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=your+brain+at+work">“Your Brain at Work: Strategies for Overcoming Distraction, Regaining Focus, and Working Smarter All Day Long”</a> by David Rock.</p>
<p>While the author clearly has not yet read any books on Coming Up With Shorter Book Titles, he has put together a compelling piece on the extreme limitations of the human <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefrontal_cortex">prefrontal cortex</a>. These are the bits that we use for important thoughts and for solving tricky technical puzzles.</p>
<p>I thought that I just naturally had the attention span of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budgerigar">budgie</a> (which I continuously try my best to compensate for by the gnashing of teeth, will power, and <a href="/2017/01/09/deep-work-a-welcome-kick-in-the-butt/">various other tricks</a>), but it turns out it’s a basic human limitation.

<p>If all of the neuroscientists he has interviewed can be believed, we are severely limited both in terms of the number of thoughts / ideas we can handle at any one time, and, to me far more frighteningly, in terms of the total time we have available for this sort of complex work.</p>
<p>The prefrontal cortex is relatively-speaking quite inefficient, and gets exhausted really quickly. Remember the last time you spent the evening trying to figure out how to get all of your children to their various activities during the week, and how unexpectedly difficult that was? (if no children, please replace this example with something more familiar to you :) Your prefrontal cortex was probably already exhausted by 15:00 in the afternoon (if not earlier), and you were in effect beating a dead neural horse.</p>
<p>Sometimes you wake up the next morning, and you solve that exact same puzzle in 3 minutes, at which point you might have already exhausted your cognition quota, and might as well stay at home for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>Because the capacity and bandwidth of the prefrontal cortex can’t (yet?) be significantly improved, the book recommends that one carefully monitors oneself, taking breaks when necessary, single-tasking, and practising any often-occurring tasks until they become automatic, at which point the much more efficient <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_ganglia">basal ganglia</a> take over.</p>
<p>Apart from this, the prefrontal cortex works at its best when you are slightly stressed, but not too much, and when you are slightly happy (with novelty and dopamine), but not too much. Too stressed, and it freezes up like a deer in the headlights of a rapidly approaching car. Too happy, and it just hangs around enjoying the vibes, not really producing anything.</p>
<p>I still have to finish the book, but it has already motivated me to continue on my quest to automate and script as much of my life and work as possible. For example, for the daily goals list mentioned in <a href="/2018/01/07/weekly-head-voices-126-fleur-de-lis/">pro-tip #1 of WHV #126</a> I have a keyboard shortcut in Emacs which creates the relevant section in the correct part of my journal, correctly timestamped, and pre-filled with one or two habits I am trying to form, ready to accept the rest of the goals for the day. I used to think examples like this were perhaps going a little too far, but I now keep my eyes open for any task or activity that can be partially or fully automated. (Some even refer to <a href="http://irreal.org/blog/?p=6641">Emacs Orgmode</a> as their exocortex.)</p>
<p>On the topic of lists, the book mentions prioritisation as one of the more cognitively taxing activities we can engage in, so it makes even more sense to take care of it first thing in the morning, and to do this as efficiently as possible.</p>
<p>More broadly speaking, I think having <em>instant</em> access to documented and <em>executable</em> conventions for most of one’s tasks and projects would help greatly to free up the precious little prefrontal quality time we are allotted.</p>
<p>Even more broadly speaking, it seems we need to practise how to <em>listen</em> more carefully to our brain so that we are able to guide it through the treacherous waters of exhaustion, stress and happiness.</p>
