My traditional year-end vacation, as per usual filled with family, friends (slightly less than usual due to genetic offspring #2 related constraints), sun, sand, beer and deep thought, helped wonderfully in my subconscious processing (the most important kind) and integration of the past year’s events.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>In spite of last year’s Space Odyssey also not quite panning out as Kubrick and Clarke might have hoped, I had a great year.

<p>I’m still working on my New Year’s resolutions, because I think it’s important to have excuses spend time thinking about one’s ways. There’s something in there about more concrete planning (I’m working on a secret list of milestones for 2011), and also about spending more time each day on the <a href="http://www.pickthebrain.com/blog/important-vs-urgent-5-ways-to-focus-on-what-really-matters/" title="important vs urgent"><em>important</em> tasks as opposed to the <em>urgent</em> tasks</a>. How about you?</p>
<p>May your journey in 2011 be at least as cool as the cyber-suburban odyssey I have planned! To get you in the right frame of mind, here’s a track from the Daft Punk soundtrack of the new <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1104001/" title="IMDB page for the Tron: Legacy movie">Tron: Legacy movie</a>:</p>

<p>P.S. I’m so old, I still vividly remember the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084827/" title="IMDB page of the first tron">first Tron movie</a>. It played a significant role in the shaping of my young character.</p>
<p>P.P.S. I’ve put my beloved E71 in storage and am now the proud owner of a charge-me-3-times-per-day-please <a href="http://www.htc.com/www/product/desirez/overview.html" title="HTC Desire Z product page">HTC Desire Z</a> micro-laptop with built-in phone. I’m going to try and write a post about it soon. Short story: In spite of the battery, I’m in love again.</p>
<p>P.P.P.S. Go and memorise <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_common_misconceptions" title="Wikipedia's list of common misconceptions">Wikipedia’s list of common misconceptions</a>. Go around correcting as many people as you can. Make new friends!</p>
<p>P.P.P.P.S. For the fetishists amongst you, here is the yearly my-feet-on-vacation photo:

Yes, that up there is my foot. Next to my beer. On my balcony. Overlooking my ocean and my clouds…
It was a ridiculously lovely holiday, with the only drawback that I wasn’t able to take more people along on it. Fear not, soon my Master Plan will come to fruition, in which my significant other will become famously rich and I’ll be able to charter a Family and Friends Boeing (or an Airbus, depending on the rules that govern such things at that time), and you’ll all be able to tag along on my Ridiculously Lovely holiday.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>Yes, that up there is my foot. Next to my beer. On my balcony. Overlooking my ocean and my clouds…</p>
<p>It was a ridiculously lovely holiday, with the only drawback that I wasn’t able to take more people along on it. Fear not, soon my Master Plan will come to fruition, in which my significant other will become famously rich and I’ll be able to charter a Family and Friends Boeing (or an Airbus, depending on the rules that govern such things at that time), and you’ll all be able to tag along on my Ridiculously Lovely holiday. Fear not, for I will not forget you.</p>
<p>2010 is now upon us. This year, I plan to create value, in as many ways as I can. I have resolved to meditate more often. I have also resolved to spend more time on meaningful communication with friends and other appreciated humans. May you have exactly the year that you desire, or the one that you need.</p>
