<p>This post quite compactly gazes back at the week from Monday May 4 to Sunday
May 10.</p>
<p>It starts with a short summary of my work week, followed by a story which you
will hopefully enjoy.</p>
<h2 id="how-was-your-week-honey">How was your week honey?</h2>
<p>I hacked on and fixed iPad microphone support in our direct-to-patient
TeleMedicine app.</p>
<p>If you are a programmer, or you have programmers in your life, you&rsquo;ll hopefully
understand the absolute catnip of technical rabbit holes that suck you in for
hours on end, only to eject you on a beautiful but extremely short-lived
dopamine deluge of discovery.</p>
<p>We integrated <a href="https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/">markdeep</a> into the performance tracking component of one of our
medical image processing pipelines.</p>
<p>Having a format, namely .md.html, which is this easy to generate
programmatically from some computational pipeline, yet results in such
attractive output documents is a great boon.</p>
<h2 id="gou-1-reveals-her-plans-and-makes-us-think--more">GOU #1 reveals her plans and makes us think (more)</h2>
<p><a href="/about/weekly-head-voices-abbreviations/">GOU #1</a> turned another year older.</p>
<p>At the dinner table on the big day, we were having a conversation about further
education in general and about postgraduate studies and PhDs in particular.</p>
<p>(She is now in high school, so these conversations are happening more often.)</p>
<p>I said that she will have to get a PhD in Physics or Math, but that I would
probably be able to make peace with a PhD in Engineering also.</p>
<p>She asked us how the PhD works, and so we explained the background as well as
we could.</p>
<p>We spent quite some time on the observation that the most important part of a
successful PhD is just never giving up.</p>
<p>Although never giving up is a chronic aspect, many PhD-veterans will tell you
that this adventure often includes a fairly acute existential crisis, mostly at
about the halfway mark.</p>
<p>This is when the candidate asks pertinent questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why, oh why did I ever think this was a good idea?</li>
<li>Is this work really worth <em>anything</em>?</li>
<li>Does anyone really care about this?</li>
<li>I wonder what the non-academic job market is like at this moment?!</li>
</ul>
<p>Fortunately in many cases, the candidate gets through this process and emerges
from the other side of the ordeal ever so slightly stronger and wiser.</p>
<p>(For those of you who have been paying attention, this crisis is like the super
deluxe version of the <a href="/2013/11/11/creative-process-stage-5-whv-67/">5-stage Creative Process</a>.)</p>
<p>I digress&hellip;</p>
<p>Talking more about the mechanics, GOU #1 asked how long a PhD thesis usually
is.</p>
<p>Off the top of my head I said: &ldquo;Around 50 thousand words, but there is of
course huge variation&rdquo;.</p>
<p>At that point she got out her phone (well, it&rsquo;s actually never not out) and
made a quick calculation, after which she quipped: &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s
straight-forward then. I&rsquo;ll spend one year planning, then I&rsquo;ll spend the year
after that writing only 136 words per day, and the year after that revising
everything to make it perfect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a simply lovely and humorous conversation to have at that moment, but
what a great point she made: If you can manage to write 136 words per day for a
year, you&rsquo;ll have 50000 words.</p>
<h3 id="the-slightly-modified-136-word-plan">The slightly modified 136 word plan</h3>
<p>136 words is really not that much if you look at it in isolation. The text
above, from right after &ldquo;I digress&hellip;&rdquo; until right before the heading above, is
exactly 136 words (if Emacs can be trusted).</p>
<p>To me the <a href="/tags/compounding/">compounding</a> nature of this act of writing such a paltry number of
words every day, but simply keeping at it for months and years, is quite
amazing.</p>
<p>So, thanks to my daughter&rsquo;s inspiration, I added a daily item to <a href="/2019/11/02/forming-and-maintaining-habits-using-orgmode/">my habit
tracker</a> that says <em>Write 100 words towards publication</em>.</p>
<p>I hope she won&rsquo;t mind that I changed the limit to 100, simply because I would
like to increase my chances of being consistent and maintaining those <a href="/2019/09/09/weekly-head-voices-177-streakers/#life-optimisation-tip-73-streak-more">streaks</a>.</p>
<p>I have added the explicit qualifier that the 100 words I write should be
towards publication: This means that my intention should be for them to end up
either in a blog post, or perhaps a future book project, or any other form of
publication that is intended for public consumption.</p>
<p>Wish me luck folks! Even better, why not join me on this journey?!</p>
<h2 id="friendly-wishes">Friendly wishes</h2>
<p>Thank you friends for meeting me here.</p>
<p>I wish you all health and kindness and contentment.</p>

Here I single out three of the tweets, but you should really read the whole thread:
When coding, I always maintain a journal in the repo (I happen to use Markdeep for this now) with a TODO list.
Tasks are at the level of one hour for &amp;ldquo;today&amp;rdquo; stuff, one day for next week, and then week- or longer level tasks.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>This weekend, Morgan McGuire, graphics and game programming god, <a href="https://twitter.com/CasualEffects/status/1241329539902570498">tweeted a
thread about his text journal based method of software development project
management</a>.</p>
<p>Here I single out three of the tweets, but you should really read the whole
thread:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When coding, I always maintain a journal in the repo (I happen to use Markdeep
for this now) with a TODO list.</p>
<p>Tasks are at the level of one hour for &ldquo;today&rdquo; stuff, one day for next week,
and then week- or longer level tasks.</p>
<p>I expand the details for the next week on Friday.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tweet 3:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I start working on the top, ~1-hour item, on the list, I immediately
expand it recursively until the subtasks are completely braindead to
implement.</p>
<p>I do all of the hard part of programming here, in the TODO list, figuring out
the library calls, designing the APIs, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tweet 4:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I get into the actual source code, I&rsquo;m just working from my own
walk-through on the TODO list, and I only need to think about syntax and code
cleanup. I can focus on programming legibly in the small instead of worrying
about the big picture.</p>

<p>This is such a brilliant way of doing the highest level &ldquo;programming&rdquo; in an
outlining tool, and then working one&rsquo;s way down until it&rsquo;s eventually time to
jump into the code.</p>
<p>I can also immediately see how well this would work in a team context.</p>
<p>During the planning session, the outline could be collaboratively fleshed
out. Furthermore, as McGuire states, it can be fleshed out differently
depending on the experience level of the team member.</p>
<p>This makes me wonder how much we as engineers <em>really</em> need the Jiras and the
YouTracks and the DevOpses of the world?</p>
<p>(Just joking folks, I know we need it, but perhaps we could do with a little
more MMMMM in our lives?)</p>
<h2 id="markdeep">Markdeep.</h2>
<p>Almost in passing McGuire mentions markdeep, the system he designed for
extremely agile technical documentation.</p>
<p>A friend from work introduced me to this years ago (thanks HB!), but then I
somehow missed its genius.</p>
<p>One of the core ideas that makes markdeep so interesting and useful, is that
the markdeep plaintext markup (it&rsquo;s like supercharged markdown) is embedded in
an extremely thin layer of HTML which invokes the markdeep.js renderer on
itself.</p>
<p>In other words, you edit the self-contained <code>.md.html</code> file with your favourite
text editor, but when you open this file in your browser, a single line of HTML
at the end pulls in <code>markdeep.min.js</code> from a CDN or from your local disc, and
renders the beautifully typeset version of the document.</p>
<p>As if that was not enough, markdeep has extensive support for the SVG rendering
of ascii art.</p>
<p>See the following pages for more information:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/">The Markdeep website</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/features.md.html">The extensive Markdeep demo
document</a> - especially
the <a href="https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/features.md.html#diagramexamples">diagram
examples</a>
are impressive!</li>
</ul>
<p>For my own notes I am sticking to <a href="https://orgmode.org/">Orgmode</a> (if you&rsquo;re an
emacs user, it&rsquo;s more powerful), but there will surely be situations where the
self-contained Markdeep makes more sense.</p>
<h2 id="the-graphics-codex">The Graphics Codex.</h2>
<p>Markdeep has been used to author a number of books, but <a href="http://graphicscodex.com/">The Graphics
Codex</a> must be one of the more amazing examples, in
terms of its interactivity and just general prettiness.</p>
<p>The iPhone app version looks like this:</p>

<p>I bought the web version not because I currently need a graphics reference, but
rather because it is a thing of beauty, and because I wanted to be able to see
better how it all works.</p>
