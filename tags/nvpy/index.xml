bibtex references in orgmode For a technical report, I thought it would be handy going from Emacs orgmode (where all my lab notes live in any case) to PDF via LaTeX.
This transformation is more or less built-in, but getting the whole machinery to work with citations from a local BibTeX export from my main Zotero database does not work out of the box.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>Too much nerdery took place from Monday February 20 to Sunday March 5.

<p>For a technical report, I thought it would be handy going from Emacs orgmode (where all my lab notes live in any case) to PDF via LaTeX.</p>
<p>This transformation is more or less built-in, but getting the whole machinery to work with citations from a local BibTeX export from my main Zotero database does not work out of the box.</p>
<p>I wrote <a href="https://vxlabs.com/2017/02/20/from-org-file-with-local-bibtex-to-latex-and-pdf/">a post on my other even-more-nerdy blog</a> showing the extra steps needed to turn this into an easy-peasy 38-shortcut-key-combo affair.</p>
<h1 id="google-gce-k80-cpus-available-cheapish">Google GCE K80 CPUs available, cheap(ish)!</h1>
<p>I’ve been using a cloud-hosted NVIDIA Tesla from Nimbix for my small-scale deep learning experiments with TensorFlow. This has also helped me to resist the temptation of buying an expensive new GPU for my workstation.</p>
<p>However, Google <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gpus/">Compute Engine has finally shipped (in beta) their cloud-based GPU product</a>. Using <a href="https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator/">their pricing calculator</a>, it turns out I can get a virtual machine with 8 CPU cores, 30G of RAM, 375GB of local SSD and a whole NVIDIA Tesla K80 GPU (12GB of memory) in their EU data centre for a paltry $1.32 / hour.</p>
<p>This is significantly less than half of what I paid Nimbix!</p>
<p>(That resistance is going to crumble, the question is just when. Having your stuff run locally and interactively for small experiments still beats the 150ms latency from this here tip of the African continent to the EU.)</p>

<p>My most successful open source project to date is probably <a href="https://github.com/cpbotha/nvpy">nvpy</a>, the cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows) Simplenote client. 600+ stars on github is not A-list, but it’s definitely also nothing to sneeze at.

<p>Anyways, I wrote nvpy in 2012 when I was still a heavy Simplenote user and there was no good client for Linux.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Emacs had started taking over my note-taking life and so in October of 2014, I made the decision to <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/nvpy/_GuWNfnxY9E/S0Vel4i4MEgJ">start looking for a new maintainer</a> for my open-source baby nvpy.</p>
<p>That attempt was not successful.</p>
<p>By the end of 2015 / early 2016 I had a bit of a Simplenote / nvpy revival, as <a href="/2016/01/05/note-taking-strategy-early-2016/">I was using the official client on my phone, and hence nvpy on the desktop</a>.</p>
<p>Emacs put a stop to that revival also by magically becoming available on my phone as well. I have to add that the Android Simplenote client also seems to have become quite sluggish.</p>
<p>I really was not using nvpy anymore, but I had to make plans for the users who did.</p>
<p>On Saturday March 4, I approached github user <a href="https://github.com/yuuki0xff">yuuki0xff</a>, who had prepared a pretty impressive background-syncing PR for nvpy, about the possibility of becoming the new owner and maintainer of nvpy.</p>
<p>To my pleasant surprise, he was happy to do so!</p>
<p>It is a strange new world that we live in where you create a useful artifact from scratch, make it available for free to anyone that would like to use it, and continue working on improving that artifact for a few years, only to hand the whole thing over to someone else for caretaking.</p>
<p>The handing-over brought with it mixed feelings, but overall I am super happy that my little creation is now in capable and more active hands.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there’s a <em>handy</em> twitter account reminding us regularly how much of 2017 we have already put behind us (thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/gvrooyen">G-J van Rooyen</a> for the tip):</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550">

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That slowly advancing progress bar seems to be very effective at getting me to take stock of the year so far.</p>
<p>Am I spending time on the right things? Am I spending just the right amount of effort on prioritising without this cogitation eating into the very resource it’s supposed to be optimising? Are my hobbies optimal?</p>
<p>I think the answer is: One deliberate step after the other is best.</p>

Last night I released version 1.0.0 of nvpy, a cross-platform (linux, mac, windows) simplenote-syncing note-taking app. nvpy is also my most popular open source baby, at least by github stars and forks. Screenshot of nvpy 1.0.0 with a demo database of notes.
Since I first released nvpy in 2012, automattic have released their own official open source desktop app for simplenote.

<p>Since I first released nvpy in 2012, <a href="https://automattic.com/">automattic</a> have released their own official open source desktop app for simplenote. Although the official app is prettier (it is electron-based), nvpy is faster and uses a fraction of the RAM (70MB RSS vs 1000MB+ RSS). Furthermore, nvpy’s syncing is more deterministic: You can see exactly when and how it syncs.</p>
<p>Personally, I use nvpy on my Linux and Mac workstations and laptops, and the official simplenote apps on my Android devices for the text-only notes <a href="/2016/01/05/note-taking-strategy-early-2016/">I always need to be with me</a>.</p>
<p>I am currently planning to write a new sqlite-based storage backend for nvpy, which should greatly speed up its interactive note-searching.</p>

I’ve talked in the past about the importance of keeping a lab journal. Initially I produced a stack of books filled with hand-scribbled notes. Although this is my favourite authoring modality, the fact that such notes can’t be easily indexed and queried (maybe one day?!) soon leads one to try electronic solutions. Over the years I’ve experimented with a number of different tools (see under “Nerd News”) to do this.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>I’m probably what one might call an obsessive note-taker.</p>
<p>I’ve <a href="https://cpbotha.net/2011/02/19/on-the-importance-of-taking-notes-weekly-head-voices-38/">talked in the past about the importance of keeping a lab journal.</a> Initially I produced a stack of books filled with hand-scribbled notes. Although this is my favourite authoring modality, the fact that such notes can’t be easily indexed and queried (maybe one day?!) soon leads one to try electronic solutions. Over the years I’ve <a href="https://cpbotha.net/2011/07/02/the-monthly-weekly-head-voices-50/">experimented with a number of different tools</a> (see under “Nerd News”) to do this.</p>
<p>This post summarises my current selection of tools.</p>
<p>For making notes with a visual aspect, for example photos of beers that I’ve tasted, and sometimes screenshots of websites, I use <a href="https://www.google.com/keep/">Google Keep</a>. This has a really great Android app with which you can easily save a website, including screenshot, using the Android “share with” functionality. On the desktop, this has a web-app that looks like this:</p>








<figure><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/keep_screenie.jpg">
    <img
        
            
            src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/keep_screenie-790x1024.jpg"
        /> </a>
</figure>

<p>One of the neat features of Keep is that you can easily have it extract and OCR text from images, for example if you’ve taken a photo of a business card. Unfortunately, the web-app is quite sluggish (this could be because I live in a bandwidth-constrained world here at the southern tip of Africa), and there’s no web clipper with which I can easily save web pages whilst on the desktop. Furthermore, I find the layout to be quite chaotic, and therefore I treat it more like my similarly chaotic digital cork board.</p>
<p>After a two year hiatus, I’ve returned to the <a href="http://simplenote.com/">SimpleNote universe</a> as my <strong>core mobile and desktop note-taking tool</strong>. They have great apps on IOS, Android, Mac and Web. I use the super sleek, some might say austere, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.automattic.simplenote">SimpleNote Android app</a> (recently rewritten when <a href="https://automattic.com/">Automattic</a>, makers of WordPress, bought Simperium, makers of SimpleNote) and on the desktop I mostly use <a href="https://github.com/cpbotha/nvpy">nvpy, my open source SimpleNote client</a>. The latest greatest version (0.10.0, soon to be released) looks like this:</p>








<figure><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/nvpy_screenie.png">
    <img
        
            
            src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/nvpy_screenie.png"
        /> </a>
</figure>

<p>Because SimpleNote is text-only, and it’s a fully synced offline-capable tool, it’s nice and fast. This is the tool you want to use to store those small but useful factoids, quotes and code snippets.</p>
<p>For more in-depth and technical lab journals, I use GNU Emacs with <a href="http://orgmode.org/">Org mode</a>. This enables me to write documents with beautifully typeset math, syntax-highlighted and in some cases even live-evaluated code blocks, and good document structure, all in plain text. Here’s a sample of my November 2015 lab journal where I started reading about and experimenting with a bit of D language:</p>








<figure><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/emacs_orgmode_screenie.png">
    <img
        
            
            src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/emacs_orgmode_screenie.png"
        /> </a>
</figure>

<p>Parts of these journals <a href="https://vxlabs.com/2014/05/25/emacs-24-with-prelude-org2blog-and-wordpress/">can be sent directly to your WordPress blog from within Emacs</a>, and you can generate high quality PDFs at the press of a typical simple 12 key Emacs shortcut combo. This being Emacs, the experience can be easily customised to emulate SimpleNote in terms of interactivity, but this will not easily compete with SimpleNote proper in terms of transparent syncing between all devices and in terms of accessibility on mobile.</p>
<p>Using these three tools together currently takes good care of my note-taking requirements. However, I think that there might be room for a fourth type of tool that is more visual, supports rich and graphical linking between data items and even between sub-components of such items and, perhaps most importantly, enables us to build note landscapes that are natively as non-linear as our thoughts.</p>
