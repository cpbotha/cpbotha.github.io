<p>The book consists of seven and a half beautifully written and amazing stories
about the human brain.</p>
<p>If you have any interest in how humans work, or in brains (and who doesn&rsquo;t?!),
and you like good stories, please purchase and read this book.</p>
<p>In the meantime, you can apply that amazing, ever-evolving, never-sleeping
chunk of information processing tissue in your skull to ingest the concepts
encoded by the words below!</p>
<h2 id="your-brain-is-not-for-thinking">Your Brain Is Not for Thinking</h2>
<p>The main reason or motivation for the evolution of the brain was not such much
the ability to think, which is admittedly an entertaining side-effect, but
rather the efficient running of the <em>body budget</em>.</p>
<p>Feldman Barrett writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A budget for your body similarly tracks resources like water, salt, and glucose
as you gain and lose them. Each action that spends resources, such as swimming
or running, is like a withdrawal from your account. Actions that replenish your
resources, such as eating and sleeping, are like deposits</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Body budgeting</em>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allostasis">allostatis</a>, refers to the idea that organisms continuously
and automatically <em>predict</em> the body&rsquo;s needs <em>before</em> they arise.</p>
<p>For the human body with all of its complexity, it&rsquo;s clear to see that
accurately predicting needs and expenditures before they arise can become
tricky, and might just require that big brain after all.</p>
<p>It becomes especially interesting when you remember that our complex social
embedding and interactions form a crucial part of our survival.</p>
<p>In other words, we&rsquo;re not just predicting the direct physical needs of our own
bodies, but a whole network of interwoven social interactions and
relationships, the effects of our actions and those of others on everyone in
that network, and the possible future implications for our requirements and
expenditures.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to need that supercomputer.</p>
<h2 id="you-have-one-brain">You Have One Brain (Not Three)</h2>
<p>Just like it is to me, I&rsquo;m sure that the idea of the triune brain, that is the
idea that the humain brain consists of three &ldquo;layers&rdquo;, namely the most
primitive &ldquo;lizard&rdquo; brain, focused on survival, the slightly more modern limbic
system for emotion on top of that and finally the neocortex, the rational part
that differentiates humans from other animals and that includes the prefrontal
cortex, is quite familiar to you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear that Feldman Barrett experiences considerable mirth when she gets to
shatter that familiar mental model for everyone reading her book.</p>
<p>After some unravelling of assumptions, she writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The triune brain idea is one of the most successful and widespread errors in
all of science. It&rsquo;s certainly a compelling story, and at times, it captures
how we feel in daily life.</p>
<p>[some text omitted]</p>
<p>But human brains don&rsquo;t work that way. Bad behavior doesn&rsquo;t come from ancient
and unbridled inner beasts. Good behavior is not the result of rationality. And
rationality and emotion are not at war . . . they do not even live in separate
parts of the brain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A bit further on, we learn that the brains of all mammals, and possibly the
brains of reptiles and other vertebrates, are &ldquo;built from a single
manufacturing plan&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In other words, in typical lazy (or efficient) Mother Nature fashion, maximal
reuse is at play here, and we&rsquo;re not special. (phew)</p>
<p>The brains follow the same manufacturing process, with the same stages in the
same order, but the stages do run for different durations depending on the
species.</p>
<p>To further ram that point home:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So the human brain has no new parts. The neurons in your brain can be found in
the brains of other mammals and, likely, other vertebrates. This discovery
undermines the evolutionary foundations of the triune brain story.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As an&hellip; erstwhile fan of pre-frontal cortex (PFC) explanations, I felt quite
directly addressed by her final assertion that it was really time to let the
triune brain go now:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anything you read or hear that proclaims the human neocortex, cerebral cortex,
or prefrontal cortex to be the root of rationality, or says that the frontal
lobe regulates so-called emotional brain areas to keep irrational behavior in
check, is simply outdated or woefully incomplete. The triune brain idea and its
epic battle between emotion, instinct, and rationality is a modern myth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The 1.5th lesson is concluded with some great advice for the future:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have one brain, not three. To move past Plato&rsquo;s ancient battle, we might
need to fundamentally rethink what it means to be rational, what it means to be
responsible for our actions, and perhaps even what it means to be human.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="your-brain-is-a-network">Your Brain Is a Network</h2>
<p>(I already had some knowledge of the brain network, but this lesson surprised
me with new knowledge on every page!)</p>
<p>Your brain is a network of 128 billion (that&rsquo;s 128 thousand million, or 128 x
10<sup>9</sup>) interconnected neurons.</p>
<p>There are very many connections&hellip;</p>
<p>How many?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each neuron directly passes information to just a few thousand other neurons
and receives information from a few thousand others, give or take, yielding
over five hundred trillion neuron-to-neuron connections.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Five hundred trillion means five hundred million million, or 500 x 10<sup>12</sup>.</p>
<p>If you went and connected each neuron with every other neuron, there would be
many more connections than this, but that would be far too expensive,
energy-wise.</p>
<p>Instead, the brain is connected just well enough to do its amazing job, in a
superbly energy-efficient way.</p>
<p>The next lesson that struck me was this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your brain network is always on. Your neurons never just sit around waiting for
something in the outside world to make them fire. Instead, all of your neurons
chat constantly with one another through their wiring. Their communications may
become stronger or weaker depending on what&rsquo;s happening in the world and in
your body, but the conversation never stops until you die.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty crazy to think (haha) that all of those connections are firing, all
the damn time.</p>
<p>It never stops, until you die.</p>
<h3 id="a-network-of-clustered-neurons-some-clusters-acting-as-long-distance-hubs">A network of clustered neurons, some clusters acting as long-distance hubs</h3>
<p>Getting back to the observation that the brain is not fully connected, but
rather sparsely so, a good next question would be &ldquo;but how exactly is it
sparsely connected?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Feldman Barrett has a crystal clear explanation of the modular
structure of the brain:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your brain network is organized in much the same way [as the network of
airports]. Its neurons are grouped into clusters that are like airports. Most
of the connections in and out of a cluster are local, so, like an airport, the
cluster serves mostly local traffic. In addition, some clusters serve as hubs
for communication. They are densely connected to many other clusters, and some
of their axons reach far across the brain and act as long-distance
connections. Brain hubs, like airport hubs, make a complicated system
efficient. They allow most neurons to participate globally even as they focus
more locally. Hubs form the backbone of communication throughout the brain</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To the best of our (where with &ldquo;our&rdquo;, I mean &ldquo;science&rsquo;s&rdquo;) knowledge, this kind
of network gives the most bang for your energy buck. It&rsquo;s extremely powerful,
yet efficient and as an added bonus actually fits into your skull.</p>
<p>I also found it interesting to read that damage to the hub clusters
specifically was associated with a number of neurological disorders, such as
depression, schizophrenia, dyslexia, chronic pain, dementia and Parkinson&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Just as would be the case with an airport network, if the airport hubs were
damaged, that would have far-reacing effects on the whole system.</p>
<h3 id="the-network-is-bathed-in-chemicals-called-neurotransmitters">The network is bathed in chemicals called neurotransmitters</h3>
<p>Each tiny neuron continuously fires its electrical signal out through its axon
into possibly thousands of downstream neurons.</p>
<p>The gap between the firing axon and the receiving neuron&rsquo;s dendrite is called a
synapse.</p>
<p>To add some more variability and flexibility to the already complex network,
the whole thing is bathed in neurotransmitters which either help or hinder that
firing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your brain wiring is bathed in chemicals that complete the local connections
between neurons. These chemicals, such as glutamate, serotonin, and dopamine,
are called neurotransmitters, and they make it easier or harder for signals to
pass across synapses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps because that wasn&rsquo;t already interesting enough, a subset of these
chemicals, notably serotonin and dopamine, can boost or diminish the effect of
other neurotransmitters, and can therefore be called <em>neuromodulators</em>.</p>
<h3 id="neurons-can-do-different-tasks-the-same-task-can-be-done-by-different-neurons">Neurons can do different tasks, the same task can be done by different neurons</h3>
<p>The common perception that each brain region is responsible for a specific task
is incorrect. Groups of neurons are indeed more likely to perform a specific
task, but there are many examples of such groups participating in various other
tasks.</p>
<p>Similarly, the same task can easily be performed by different sets of neurons,
a phenomenon called <em>degeneracy</em>.</p>
<p>Feldman Barrett notes that even reaching for the exact same thing twice in a
row will engage different sets of neurons.</p>
<h3 id="slow-to-fast-changes-complexity-is-key-in-dealing-with-our-reality">Slow to fast changes, complexity is key in dealing with our reality</h3>
<p>I really liked the explanation of how the brain adapts to the world at
different speeds:</p>
<ul>
<li>Slow changes by learning / rewiring connections / plasticity.</li>
<li>Faster changes by neurotransmitters and neuromodulators.</li>
<li>Neurons performing multiple jobs.</li>
</ul>
<p>The network needs to be this complex because:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip; your brain can create massive numbers of different patterns by combining
bits and pieces of old patterns it has made before. The result is a brain that
runs its body efficiently in a world full of constantly changing situations by
recalling patterns that helped in the past and generating new ones to try.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&hellip; and then further down, this intriguing observation on memories not being
stored, but being reconstructed on demand:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brains of higher complexity can remember more. A brain doesn&rsquo;t store memories
like files in a computer—it reconstructs them on demand with electricity and
swirling chemicals. We call this process remembering but it&rsquo;s really
assembling. A complex brain can assemble many more memories than either
Meatloaf Brain or Pocketknife Brain could. And each time you have the same
memory, your brain may have assembled it with a different collection of
neurons.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This lesson is wrapped up with the mind-expanding (haha) realization that the
brain encompasses more than just the neurons in your head:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your brain is more than just neurons. It includes blood vessels and various
fluids that I haven&rsquo;t talked about. It also includes other kinds of brain
cells, called glial cells, that function in ways that scientists don&rsquo;t fully
understand yet. Your brain network may even extend, surprisingly, into your gut
and intestines, where scientists have found microbes that communicate with your
brain via neuro-transmitters.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="little-brains-wire-themselves-to-their-world">Little Brains Wire Themselves to Their World</h2>
<p>Please note, teenagers and other young adults, your brain is only fully formed
when you reach the ripe old age of 25!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip; little human brains are born under construction. They don&rsquo;t take on their
full adult structure and function until they finish their principal wiring, a
process that takes about twenty-five years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This has interesting and far-reaching consequences for the best approach to
work with younger humans. They might walk like adults and talk like adults,
when in fact they still need a few years of brain maturation before being fully
responsible.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the record for humans older than 25 is also not that
impressive.</p>
<p>Half-jokes aside, it is fascinating and quite terrifying to read how much a
human child is, often irrevocably, formed by its environment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To a remarkable extent, a baby&rsquo;s genes are guided and regulated by the
surrounding environment. The brain areas that are most centrally involved in
vision, for example, develop normally after birth only if a baby&rsquo;s retinas are
regularly exposed to light. An infant&rsquo;s brain also learns to locate sounds in
the world based on the specific shape of the baby&rsquo;s ear. To make matters even
stranger, a baby&rsquo;s body requires some additional genes that sneak in from the
outside world. These tiny visitors travel inside of bacteria and other critters
and affect the brain in ways that scientists are only beginning to understand</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot more later, but this is a good introduction of the idea that our
brains, our very identities, are so intertwined with the external world, and
especially so when we are small and quite helpless.</p>
<p>Parents <em>really</em> need to do their utmost best.</p>
<p>The child&rsquo;s brain develops into its adult complexity via two processes called
<em>tuning</em> and <em>pruning</em>.</p>
<p><em>Tuning</em> means that neural connections that are used often become stronger. At
a cellular level this happens through the myelin sheaths around axons (the
neurons output) becoming thicker, facilitating signal transmission, and also
through the dendrites (the inputs) becoming bushier.</p>
<p><em>Pruning</em> means that neural connections that are not really used weaken and
disappear. Here Feldman Barrett invokes one of my favourite principles when
trying to understand the ruthless efficiency in human physiology: <a href="https://cpbotha.net/2020/12/23/weekly-head-voices-212-use-it-or-lose-it/#use-it-or-lose-it">Use it or
lose it</a>.</p>
<p>In the case of the developing child, it starts with far more neurons than an
adult brain needs. This is great for a brain that will need to adapt to a range
of new situations. However, once the situation is known, the unused neurons and
connections are ruthlessly pruned away to result eventually in a more efficient
brain.</p>
<p>Feldman Barrett proceeds to give a number of compelling examples how the baby&rsquo;s
caretakers and the environment that they create play an absolutely crucial role
in the <em>physical</em> development of the new neural network.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Little brains require a social world in order to develop typically. You&rsquo;ve
already learned that babies need certain physical inputs, such as photons of
light bombarding their retinas, or their brains will never develop normal
vision. It turns out that they also need social inputs from other humans who
guide their attention, speak or sing to them, and cuddle them at key
moments. If these needs aren&rsquo;t met, things can go terribly wrong.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She then discusses a horrible example where thousands of Romanian babies found
themselves in orphanages in the 1960s due to terrible leadership decisions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In some orphanages, babies were warehoused in rows of cribs, with little
stimulation or social interaction. Nurses or caregivers would come in and feed
them, change them, and put them back in the cribs. That was about it.</p>
<p>[text ommitted]</p>
<p>As a consequence of this social neglect, the Romanian orphans grew up
intellectually impaired. They had problems learning language. They had
difficulty concentrating and resisting distractions, probably because nobody
had shared attention with them, so their brains never developed the wiring for
an effective spotlight. They also had trouble controlling themselves. Alongside
the children&rsquo;s mental and behavioral issues, their bodies were stunted, most
likely because they grew up without caregivers to keep their body budgets
solvent. This meant their brains never learned to budget effectively. A little
brain wires itself to its environment, and when that environment is missing key
elements for healthy body budgeting, critical brain wiring can be pruned away.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Based on this and far too many other observations, it is clear that children
absolutely need to be well cared for, both physically and socially, in order to
have a chance to develop into healthy adults.</p>
<p>This is a fundamental mechanism that can&rsquo;t be easily remedied later.</p>
<p>She continues with this line of discussion into the now even more relevant
poverty cycle phenomenon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Research shows that early and long exposure to poverty is bad for the
developing brain. Inadequate nutrition, interrupted sleep due to street noise,
poor temperature regulation due to lack of heat or ventilation, and other
circumstances of poverty may alter the development of the front of the cerebral
cortex, namely the prefrontal cortex. This brain area is involved in a range of
critical functions, including attention, language, and body
budgeting. Scientists are still studying the ways that poverty affects brain
development, but we do know that it&rsquo;s linked to poorer performance in school
and fewer years of education. These burdens ultimately increase a child&rsquo;s risk
of living in poverty when he grows up and has children of his own</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, this lesson is wrapped up with the observation that nature and nurture
are deeply and intricately intertwined:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When it comes to the brain, simple distinctions like nature versus nurture are
alluring but not realistic. We have the kind of nature that <em>requires</em>
nurture. Your genes require a physical and social environment &ndash; a niche filled
with other humans who shared your infant gaze, spoke to you with intent, set
your sleep schedule, and controlled your body temperature &ndash; in order to
produce a finished brain</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="your-brain-predicts--almost--everything-you-do">Your Brain Predicts (Almost) Everything You Do</h2>
<p>Readers of my personal blog might remember <a href="https://cpbotha.net/2019/07/25/weekly-head-voices-174-i-row-row-row-your-boat/#life-is-but-a-dream">my story in 2019 about the brain
being stuck in the dark bony cage we call &ldquo;skull&rdquo;</a>, taking fairly limited
sensory inputs, and in actual fact dreaming up all of one&rsquo;s reality on demand,
a story <a href="https://cpbotha.net/2019/10/07/weekly-head-voices-180-ensembleyou-and-the-describers/#the-describers">I later found out was also called transcendental idealism</a>.</p>
<p>At the start of lesson 4, Feldman Barrett writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scientists used to believe that the brain’s visual system operated sort of like
a camera, detecting the visual information “out there” in the world and
constructing a photograph-like image in the mind. Today we know better. Your
view of the world is no photograph. It’s a construction of your brain that is
so fluid and so convincing that it appears to be accurate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&hellip; and then comes the brain stuck in a box story again!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the moment you’re born to the moment you draw your last breath, your brain
is stuck in a dark, silent box called your skull. Day in and day out, it
continually receives sense data from the outside world via your eyes, ears,
nose, and other sensory organs. This data does not arrive in the form of the
meaningful sights, smells, sounds, and other sensations that most of us
experience. It’s just a barrage of light waves, chemicals, and changes in air
pressure with no inherent significance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most probably I picked this up somewhere on the echoing internet waves. Lex
Fridman podcast would be my bet, but not <a href="https://lexfridman.com/lisa-feldman-barrett/">the Feldman Barrett episode</a> because
that only came out in October of 2020.</p>
<p>However, this lesson is not only about your brain being stuck in a box, but the
observation that your brain is constantly predicting what&rsquo;s going to happen
next.</p>
<p>This is perhaps even more extreme than you might guess.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What happens next still astounds me, even as a neuroscientist. If your brain
has predicted well, then your neurons are already firing in a pattern that
matches the incoming sense data. That means this sense data itself has no
further use beyond confirming your brain’s predictions. What you see, hear,
smell, and taste in the world and feel in your body in that moment are
completely constructed in your head. By prediction, your brain has efficiently
prepared you to act.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So yes, it seems we are mostly all in fact dreaming together in a highly
synchronized fashion.</p>
<h2 id="your-brain-secretly-works-with-other-brains">Your Brain Secretly Works with Other Brains</h2>
<p>This aspect fascinated me during the podcast with Lex Fridman:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part of being a social species, it turns out, is that we regulate one another&rsquo;s
body budgets &ndash; the ways in which our brains manage the bodily resources we use
every day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As if it wasn&rsquo;t already trick enough that we regulate our own body budgets, we
also have a profound effect on each other&rsquo;s body budgets, an effect that we
ideally put to good use for positive regulation.</p>
<p>The stress that we often experience due to interaction with our fellow humans
plays a prominent role in this lesson.</p>
<p>In the workplace, having great colleagues that you can trust will leave more
energy to do your work better:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When people work in an environment where they can learn to trust one another,
they&rsquo;ll have less burden on their body budgets, saving resources that can be
invested in new ideas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Profoundly, but probably not surprisingly, our prediction machines have a much
easier time modelling humans that are similar to us, and conversely a much more
difficult time working with fellow humans that are different from us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you have empathy for other people, your brain predicts what they&rsquo;ll think
and feel and do. The more familiar the other people are to you, the more
efficiently your brain predicts their inner struggles. The whole process feels
obvious and natural, as if you were reading another person&rsquo;s mind. But there&rsquo;s
a catch—when people are less familiar to you, it can be harder to
empathize. You might have to learn more about the person, an extra effort that
translates into more withdrawals from your body budget, which can feel
unpleasant. This may be one reason why people sometimes fail to empathize with
those who look different or believe different things than they do and why it
can feel uncomfortable to try. It&rsquo;s metabolically costly for a brain to deal
with things that are hard to predict.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This only underlines the fact that we really have no choice but to put in the
best effort that we can to support and cultivate more diversity.</p>
<p>Like in many other situations, mother nature can&rsquo;t be trusted here either, so
we have to apply our humanity to make up for her failings.</p>
<p>Next Feldman Barrett discusses the central role of speech also in how we
regulate each other&rsquo;s stress levels:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Primates like monkeys and chimpanzees also use vision to regulate each other&rsquo;s
nervous systems. Humans are unique in the animal kingdom, however, because we
also regulate each other with words. A kind word may calm you, as when a friend
gives you a compliment at the end of a hard day. A hateful word from a bully
may cause your brain to predict threat and flood your bloodstream with
hormones, squandering precious resources from your body budget.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is of course accurate and makes complete sense to me, but I have never
thought about it in these explicit co-regulation terms.</p>
<p>What follows is an important warning that it really does not matter what the
source of the stress is, if it continues, it will all pile up over time and it
will harm you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to understand that the human brain doesn&rsquo;t seem to distinguish
between different sources of chronic stress. If your body budget is already
depleted by the circumstances of life—like physical illness, financial
hardship, hormone surges, or simply not sleeping or exercising enough—your
brain becomes more vulnerable to stress of all kinds. This includes the
biological effects of words designed to threaten, bully, or torment you or
people you care about. When your body budget is continually burdened, momentary
stressors pile up, even the kind that you&rsquo;d normally bounce back from
quickly. It&rsquo;s like children jumping on a bed. The bed might withstand ten kids
bouncing at the same time, but the eleventh one snaps the bed frame.  Simply
put, a long period of chronic stress can harm a human brain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, contrary to the popular idiom, the wrong sorts of words <em>can</em> and
<em>will</em> cause bodily harm:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re exposed to verbal nastiness continually for months and months or
if you live in an environment that persistently and relentlessly taxes your
body budget, words can indeed physically injure your brain. Not because you&rsquo;re
weak or a so-called snowflake, but because you&rsquo;re a human. Your nervous system
is bound up with the behavior of other humans, for better or for worse. You can
argue what the data means or if it&rsquo;s important, but it is what it is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She explains that when you&rsquo;re exposed to social stress within two hours from a
meal, you even metabolize the foods from that meal much worse than you normally
would.</p>
<p>She summarises the whole idea with the following observation, and perhaps this
is that one thing we should take home with us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The best thing for your nervous system is another human. The worst thing for
your nervous system is also another human</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="our-interconnectedness-and-our-personal-freedom">Our interconnectedness and our personal freedom</h3>
<p>Feldman Barrett has an extremeley timely piece at the end of this chapter
about how our inescapable (and fantastic) interconnectedness has significant
implications for our personal freedoms.</p>
<p>First, she makes clear how deeply we have always affected each other, and how
inescapable this is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After all, history is filled with examples of overcoming our biology so we can
live our values. Other people carry germs, for example, that can make us sick
or even kill us, but only in the most nightmarish cases do we legislate a
solution that restricts our personal freedoms. More commonly, we cooperate and
innovate. We invent soap, we bump elbows instead of shaking hands, we search
for new medicines and vaccines, and so on. If this is insufficient, experts
tell us we&rsquo;re supposed to voluntarily isolate ourselves and practice social
distancing. Even in a free society, our actions affect one another in ways that
are, like viruses, often invisible to us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&hellip; and then she completes this train of reasoning with the observation that
personal freedom does have a great associated cost which is often exacted from
others:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scientists are often asked to make their research useful to everyday
life. These scientific findings about words, chronic stress, and disease are a
perfect example. There is a real biological benefit when people treat one
another with basic human dignity. And if we don&rsquo;t, there is also a real
biological consequence, and it eventually trickles down to a financial and
social cost for everyone. The price of personal freedom is personal
responsibility for your impact on others. The wiring of all of our brains
guarantees it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is clear that personal freedom has to be balanced carefully with cost to
others, where the latter does have precedence.</p>
<h2 id="brains-make-more-than-one-kind-of-mind">Brains Make More than One Kind of Mind</h2>
<p>She starts this chapter about the sometimes large differences differences
between humans with the great example that people from Bali in Indonesia <em>fall
asleep when they are very afraid</em>, while most Western folks are more likely to
freeze on the spot, eyes wide, and gasp.</p>
<p>Perhaps even more fundamental than that, those same folks who grep up in Bali,
or in the Illongot culture in the Philippines, don&rsquo;t experience <em>thinking</em> and
<em>feeling</em> as two separate concepts, like most Westerners do, but rather as a
single thing.</p>
<p>She has more examples like this, but her overarching statement is that the same
physical brain can produce and house quite different <em>minds</em>.</p>
<p>Importantly, variation is the norm.</p>
<p>Physical brains do have many common features, but minds by definition less so,
because of the great adaptability of the underlying physical brains.</p>
<p>She gives another example pointing out that the Western idea of the body and
mind as separate interacting constructs is also not the norm:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brains have a lot of common features; minds, less so, because minds depend in
part on micro-wiring that is tuned and pruned by culture. For example, many
Western cultures draw strong dividing lines between the mental and the
physical. If your stomach hurts, you&rsquo;re likely to visit your primary care
physician or a gastroenterologist; if you’re feeling anxiety, you&rsquo;re more
likely to see a psychologist, even if the symptoms and the underlying causes
are identical. But in some Eastern cultures, such as those that practice
Buddhism, mind and body are much more integrated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As an aside, with all the work that is currently happening on the microbiome,
showing how bacteria in your gut can and do affect your mood and personality,
it is starting to look like the body-and-mind-in-one perspective could be
closer to reality.</p>
<p>I highlighted the following paragraph, because (as an engineer and a data
person) I found it an intriguing idea that your brain is summarising in
real-time, down to a single metric called &ldquo;affect&rdquo;, the storm of external and
internal data that it has to deal with.</p>
<p>In other words, <em>affect</em> is a single metric, or rather feeling, that summarises
the complete state of your whole system.</p>
<p>Feldman Barrett writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where does affect come from? In every moment &ndash; like right now, as you read
these words &ndash; your hormones, organs, and immune system are producing a storm
of sense data, and you&rsquo;re barely aware of it. You notice your heartbeat and
breathing only when they&rsquo;re intense or you focus on them. You almost never
notice your body temperature unless it&rsquo;s too high or too low. Your brain,
however, makes meaning from this data storm continuously to predict your body’s
next action and meet its metabolic needs before they arise. In the midst of all
this activity inside you, something miraculous happens. Your brain summarizes
what&rsquo;s going on with your body in the moment, and you feel that summary as
affect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, for better or for worse, it is possible to modify your mind with
chemicals or with experiences:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can modify your mind. People do this all the time. College students use
caffeine or amphetamines to create minds that can pull an all-nighter before a
final exam. Partygoers drink alcohol to create minds that are more relaxed and
less inhibited in social situations (and miraculously, other people around them
suddenly become much more attractive). These chemical modifications last for
only a short time. For longer-lasting modifications, you can try new
experiences or learn new things to rewire your brain, as we discussed in
earlier lessons.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She mentions that one of the most challenging experiences in terms of changing
your mind is moving to another culture.</p>
<p>The lesson is concluded with the following re-iteration of its central point,
the malleability of the mind:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When it comes to human minds, variation is the norm, and what we call &ldquo;human
nature&rdquo; is really many human natures. We don&rsquo;t need one universal mind in order
to claim that we are all one species. All we need is an exceptionally complex
brain that wires itself to its physical and social surroundings.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="our-brains-can-create-reality">Our Brains Can Create Reality</h2>
<p>This is such an amazing chapter, which I really hope that you are able to read
in its full form.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, here I&rsquo;ll try to summarise the main gist.</p>
<p>Humans have the unique ability to create <em>social reality</em>.</p>
<p>The country that you live in, its name, the exact border surrounding it, the
customs and the laws that you share with your fellow citizens, the right way to
act at a party, and so on&hellip;</p>
<p>All of that was <em>synthesized</em>, created out of nothing, by a bunch of human
minds.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we have demonstrated in many cases that we are able to keep these
social realities operational for thousands of years.</p>
<p>Scientists do not know for sure how our brains developed this capability, but
they suspect it is based on what Feldman Barrett calls the Five Cs:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Creativity</dt>
<dd>We are able to draw a border and then invent a country with a
national identity and a bunch of rules.</dd>
<dt>Communication</dt>
<dd>Millions of brains are subsequently able to communicate our
new country and its rules to each other, and to keep each other up to date.</dd>
<dt>Copying</dt>
<dd>Our children learn how to operate by copying us. Similarly, we
learn form each other by copying behaviour.</dd>
<dt>Cooperation</dt>
<dd>We cooperate on a geographical scale. The book quite casually
mentions the example of food distribution, all the way from farms anywhere on
the globe onto your plate for dinner.</dd>
<dt>Compression</dt>
<dd>This concept definitely needs a bit more space, so I&rsquo;ll
continue in the text below.</dd>
</dl>
<p>You&rsquo;ll recall from a previous lesson that <a href="#your-brain-is-a-network">your brain is a (giant) network</a>.</p>
<p>What was not emphasised in that lesson (or my notes), is the massive
abstraction capability inherent in our brain architectures.</p>
<p>There are millions of neurons bringing in signals from the photosensitive
receptors in your retina. After a few centimetres, those neural pathways
connect <em>in groups</em> to summarising neurons, which combine each group&rsquo;s
information into a single signal.</p>
<p>All of those summarising neurons output into yet another layer of
well-connected summarising neurons.</p>
<p>This process of successive summarisation continues all the way into the front
of your brain, which contains the highest level of summarisation, that is, the
fewest number of mega-neurons that aggregate effectively massive amounts of
information from all of the lower levels indirectly feeding into them.</p>
<p>I hope that it is obvious now why this successive summarisation is also
referred to as <em>compression</em>.</p>
<p>So what does this <em>compression</em> buy us humans?</p>
<p>This extreme level of compression enables us to <em>think
abstractly</em>. Abstraction, together with the rest of the Five Cs enables us to
create and maintain social reality.</p>
<p>Feldman Barrett wraps it up like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The wiring of your cerebral cortex makes compression possible. Compression
enables sensory integration. Sensory integration enables
abstraction. Abstraction permits your highly complex brain to issue flexible
predictions based on the functions of things rather than on their physical
form. That is creativity. And you can share these predictions by way of
communication, cooperation, and copying. That is how the Five Cs empower a
human brain to create and share social reality</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No other animal brain can achieve the extreme levels of compression and
abstraction required to create social reality.</p>
<p>As if this chapter in the book was not amazing enough, Feldman Barrett
discusses the benefits and disadvantages of our reality creation superpower.</p>
<p>As an example of the disadvantages, I strongly agree with her view on our often
stupid fascination with boxes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, humans vary tremendously, like every animal species does. But
unlike the rest of the animal kingdom, we organize some of this variation into
little boxes with labels such as race, gender, and nationality. We treat the
labeled boxes as if they&rsquo;re part of nature when in fact we build them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would like to conclude this section with a part of the book&rsquo;s conclusion to
this inspiring chapter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Social reality is a superpower that emerges from an ensemble of human
brains. It gives us the possibility to chart our own destiny and even influence
the evolution of our species. We can make up abstract concepts, share them,
weave them into a reality, and conquer just about any environment &ndash; natural,
political, or social &ndash; as long as we work together. We have more control over
reality than we might think. We also have more responsibility for reality than
we might realize.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="a-summary-of-the-summary">A summary of the summary</h2>
<p>For those of you that have no time to read the book or even these book notes,
Feldman Barrett has a super compact summary of her seven and a half lessons in
the epilogue.</p>
<p>The human brain is:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A brain that constructs such rich mental experiences that we feel like
emotion and reason wrestle inside us</li>
<li>A brain that&rsquo;s so complex that we describe it by metaphors and mistake them
for knowledge</li>
<li>A brain that&rsquo;s so skilled at rewiring itself that we think we&rsquo;re born with
all sorts of things that we actually learn</li>
<li>A brain that&rsquo;s so effective at hallucinating that we believe we see the world
objectively, and so fast at predicting that we mistake our movements for
reactions</li>
<li>A brain that regulates other brains so invisibly that we presume we&rsquo;re
independent of each other</li>
<li>A brain that creates so many kinds of minds that we assume there&rsquo;s a single
human nature to explain them all</li>
<li>A brain that&rsquo;s so good at believing its own inventions that we mistake social
reality for the natural world</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="my-advent-of-code-comes-to-an-end">My Advent of Code comes to an end</h2>
<p>You might remember from <a href="/2020/12/12/weekly-head-voices-211-table-mountain-run-ish/#advent-of-code-2020">WHV #211 that I was really enjoying the Advent of Code 2020</a>.</p>
<p>As I hinted there, I was happy to reach my modest goal of the double digits (i.e. day 10).</p>
<p>On day 20 however (which is of course December 20), the puzzle took up so much
of my time that I decided, with significant difficulty (remember these puzzles
are like cat nip for nerds), to drop out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been great fun, and I learned so much <a href="https://nim-lang.org/">nim</a> in such a short period, but at
some point one has to make the call whether the time cost is justified by the
fun and the learning.</p>
<p>P.S. It took about two days to finally let go. :)</p>
<h2 id="use-it-or-lose-it">Use it, or lose it</h2>
<p>I am currently reading the fascinating book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51778153-livewired"><em>Livewired: The Inside Story of the
Ever-Changing Brain</em></a> by neuro-scientist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David%5FEagleman">David Eagleman</a>.</p>
<p>As you can probably deduce from the title, this book is about how the brain
never stops rewiring itself.</p>
<p>Even now as you&rsquo;re reading these words, your brain is making and breaking
connections, and changing chemical balances, as it crunches through and
sometimes integrates the ideas that are invoked by this weird trick we humans
do, called <em>speech</em>, and the even weirder trick, called <em>writing</em>.</p>
<p>(Writing: Your retinae count the photons coming from the screen on which you&rsquo;re
reading this, construct patterns of darkness and light, convert those patterns
to words, and then string together those words into living, breathing
simulations of reality in your giant neural network.)</p>
<p>Besides functioning as an awe-inspiring exploration of the inner workings of
the brain and the nervous system, also for me with a little bit of existing
background, the book explains the phenomenon that inside the brain there is a
never-ending struggle between brain regions, between neurons and between the
thoughts that they store.</p>
<p>If you are blindfolded for a few days, your audio cortex will start annexing
parts of your visual cortex. If you&rsquo;re blindfolded for long enough (don&rsquo;t do
this), your visual cortex could be repurposed completely.</p>
<p>Neurons compete for incoming data, memories compete for neurons; it&rsquo;s a
continual fight for existence.</p>
<p>When a new, more important or more stressful memory arrives, it can push out,
into eternal oblivion, an older, less interesting memory.</p>
<p>If an input data stream like sight or hearing stops, another strong input
stream will take over those neurons. When you stop practising long division, or
algebraic simplification, you&rsquo;ll first start to get slower, and then later lose
that ability.</p>
<p>Those neurons have been repurposed.</p>
<p>(The book posits a really interesting hypothesis for why humans dream so
visually: Your eyes are closed for a large part of the day. Your visual cortex
would take a beating every night, i.e. be taken over by other parts of your
brain, if you didn&rsquo;t use it so actively during dreaming every night.)</p>
<p>You can probably see where this is going.</p>
<p>In the brain, just like in the rest of your human physiology, efficiency is
everything.</p>
<p>The moment you stop practising a certain function, like math, or absorbing
technical documents, or programming, or driving, or running, or being kind,
your system will start to try to repurpose as much as possible of the required
subsystems for other functions that you <em>are</em> actively deploying.</p>
<p>In short: <em>Use it, or lose it.</em></p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to have to keep on practising all of the things you find important
until the day all of it stops for the last time.</p>
<p>This may seem quite harsh, but man, does it keep us honest.</p>

<h2 id="when-life-hands-you-lemons-build-a-battery">When life hands you lemons, build a battery</h2>
<p>Genetic Offspring Unit (GOU) #1 had to do a show and tell at school, so I
helped her to construct a battery from 4 lemons. Besides that because of this I
got to refresh my own knowledge (can <i>you</i> remember exactly why a battery
such as this works?!) we got to chat about molecules, atoms, protons, neutrons,
electrons, atomic numbers and the periodic table.</p>
<p>The next day she quite coolly took the whole kit to school, proceeded to
connect up the disassembled kit before the class, and got the little LED to
switch on, all the while explaining in high-level 9-year-old-ish how it worked.</p>
<p>In case you’re wondering, the experiment looked like this:</p>

<p>With zinc-covered screws and heavy duty stripped copper wire, we got about 0.9V per lemon. There was enough current to light up a small 3V LED.</p>
<p>(Will GOU#1 one day become an engineer? Stay tuned to this blog for the next 10 years to find out!)</p>
<h2 id="taking-a-break-from-facebook">Taking a break from Facebook</h2>
<p>One of my more interesting Facebook friends announced that she was taking a break from Facebook, because “this stuff is toxic and no good”.</p>
<p>This made me evaluate what I thought of FB at the moment.</p>
<p><i>Toxic</i> is a strong word, but after thinking about this for a while, I have to admit that a large part of the time I spend on the site is probably not that good for my karma. The problem is that there are a whole bunch of friends I really would like to stay in contact with, but for the most part they are quite silent. The people that do pipe up the most on FB are people with some or other silly and/or misguided agenda.</p>
<p>Although <a href="http://cpbotha.net/2014/07/01/weekly-head-voices-76-someone-is-wrong-on-the-internet/">I have learnt to stop correcting the infinite number of people who are wrong on the internet</a>, I’m still reading their contributions, getting slightly worked up, formulating a response, and then resisting posting it, all of this a number of times per day.</p>
<p>To the question whether seeing the one or two positive and life-affirming posts is justified by a seemingly much larger number of the opposite, my response has also become to take a break from Facebook and to see for myself.</p>
<p>I’m not going to cancel my account, so I will receive notifications for example when people message me, but I’m just going to stop checking the site completely. I am also giving myself permission to post new WHV editions there now and then: It’s sometimes the best way to reach some of those silent but desirable FB friends I mentioned, because not all of them are subscribed to this blog. THAT’S A SUBTLE HINT SILENT BUT DESIRABLE FRIENDS.</p>
<p>(BTW, I’m almost 3 days in now, so far no problems. I’ll report back in future WHVs.)</p>
<h2 id="the-mind-is-a-terrible-thing-to-taste">The mind is a terrible thing to taste</h2>
<p>This week I learned about <a href="http://www.nih.gov/researchmatters/october2013/10282013clear.htm">fascinating sleeping brain research</a> (that summary is from the NIH, also see <a href="http://news.sciencemag.org/brain-behavior/2013/10/sleep-ultimate-brainwasher">this one by Science Magazine</a>) that was published in 2013.</p>
<p>In short, when mice sleep, the area between their brain cells is temporarily increased by 60% (!!), and the cerebro-spinal fluid between the cells flows much more rapidly than when they’re awake. This rapid flow literally flushes out of the brain the toxins that build up during the waking hours. HOW COOL IS THAT?!</p>








<figure><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/wpid-sciencemag_brainwash.jpg">
    <img

            <p>Toxins flushed out via bright blue channels between brain cells. Image from Science Mag summary linked above.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Going down one detail level, the researchers showed that the glial cells (the non-neuronal cells in the brain) control the flow of cerebro-spinal fluid through channels in their cell membranes. By using different coloured dyes, they showed that there was significantly more flow during sleeping than when awake, clearing out toxins twice as quickly.</p>
<p>This research took place in mice, but the researchers hypothesise that this same mechanism operates in humans, and <a href="https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/labs/nedergaard-lab/projects/glymphatic_system">are working on verifying that this is the case</a>.</p>

It turns out that when any normal human being is faced with observations or evidence that oppose their already formed opinions, they tend to ignore or downplay the value of those observations.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p><em>(This post has a point.

<p>It turns out that when any normal human being is faced with observations or evidence that oppose their already formed opinions, they tend to ignore or downplay the value of those observations. Conversely, any scrap of evidence that seems to confirm the opinion in question is considered to be good and trustworthy evidence. This is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias" title="Wikipedia page concerning confirmation bias"><strong>confirmation bias</strong></a>: You and I both suffer from it, and it can be a dangerous phenomenon. Ideally, we would be able to judge the evidence and come to a reasonable decision, but this turns out to be exceptionally hard.

<p>Another interesting one is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_fallacy" title="Wikipedia page about planning fallacy"><strong>planning fallacy</strong></a>: We are apparently hard-wired to underestimate the time we’ll need to complete some or other task. In other words, you always think you’ll need far less time to complete that project than you’ll end up using. Most of you have experienced this first-hand, or indirectly, when some huge IT or building project falls <em>way</em> behind schedule (and budget).</p>
<p>There is a whole <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases" title="Wikipedia list of cognitive biases">list of such <strong>cognitive biases</strong></a>. As I’ve <a href="/2010/05/13/the-next-level-weekly-head-voices-22/" title="Previous post mentioning cognitive biases.">mentioned before</a>, we’re basically walking jugs filled to the brim with misunderstandings, and mostly we’re unaware of it. Now you might think to yourself: <em>But surely I’m better and more logical than the rest!</em> I’m sorry to have to disappoint you, but you’re even biased about your biases. It’s called the <a href="http://www.mindhacks.com/blog/2009/07/unique_like_everyone.html" title="the bias blind spot at mindhacks.com"><strong>bias blind spot</strong></a>, a meta-bias that means you’ll always estimate your own unbiasedness more highly than that of your neighbour.</p>
<p>I hope you didn’t nod off right there, because the next topic I’d like to touch on is that of <strong>sleep</strong> (please excuse the lame joke, I needed it for the continuity). Ever thought of exactly why you get sleepy at night? Or why your teenager (or teenage sibling, or yourself; substitute whatever’s more relevant) is not able to go to bed or wake up on time? Mostly we just go through the (sleep) motions without asking <em>why</em> or <em>how</em>. When you’re exposed to light in the morning, your eyes talk to your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suprachiasmatic_nucleus" title="Wikipedia page on the SCN">supra-chiasmatic nucleus (SCN)</a>, a  cluster of brain-cells about the size of a grain of rice in your already small hypothalamus, which then, minute as it, starts raising your body temperature, releases the cortisol hormone (this gives you a boost) and stops the release of melatonin. When it gets dark, the SCN throws a switch which causes the pineal gland (itself just pea-sized) to start producing melatonin, another hormone, but one that makes you feel generally less alert and altogether sleepy, so you start thinking about that wonderfully fluffy and soft bed of yours, and it gets harder and harder to stay awake.</p>
<p>I find that really fascinating: There it is, the SCN, a rice grain sized clock that orchestrates the daily rhythm of your whole super-complex body! This helps us to explain to our toddlers why they should go to bed earlier: <em>Because your melatonin is activated much earlier honey!</em> (There’s no arguing with that, even when you’re 4 years old.) It also explains teenagers’ sleeping habits: Adolescent hormones and life-style seem to interfere with melatonin production, and so teenagers get their melatonin kick <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/humanbody/mind/articles/emotions/teenagers/sleep.shtml" title="teenagers get sleepy later">hours later than adults</a>.</p>
<p>The hypothalamus consists of more interesting nuclei than <em>just</em> the SCN. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcuate_nucleus" title="wikipedia page on arcuate nucleus">arcuate nucleus</a> also lives there, and it’s one of the spots in your brain that produces <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine" title="wikipedia page on dopamine"><strong>dopamine</strong></a>. Dopamine rules your life. It plays an important role in just about every bit of your humanity that you care about: Motivation, punishment and reward, sleep, mood, attention, sexual gratification, learning, and so on. Dopamine is instrumental in drug addiction, and, perhaps unsurprisingly, also in ensuring that one human becomes completely and irrevocably obsessed with another when <strong>falling in love</strong>. Serotonin and norepinephrine are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_basis_for_love" title="wikipedia page on chemical basis for love.">also involved</a>, but dopamine is the one that makes you go completely crazy. Once you get past the crazies and you have the good fortune of finding yourself in a <strong>longer term relationship</strong>, guess what? Once again, there’s not really that much magic or even that much mystery: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxytocin" title="wikipedia page on oxytocin">Oxytocin</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasopressin" title="wikipedia page on vasopressin">vasopressin</a>, two hormones that also act as neurotransmitters, help to ensure that you experience the warm-fuzzies when with your partner and hence facilitate the pair-bonding experience. Oxytocin also plays a crucial role in breastfeeding (our friend the hypothalamus notices sucking at the breast and kicks the oxytocin production into gear that gets the milk going to where it needs to be). Conveniently, it probably also plays a role in <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/10/071015110059.htm" title="sciencedaily on oxytocin and mother-infant bonding"><strong>mother-infant bonding</strong></a>.</p>
<p>I could harp on for a long time about how exactly all of these (and many other) little tidbits determine your life, but by now, I hope that I’ve said enough and that you’re asking: <strong>What’s your point Vanessa?!</strong>.</p>
<p>My point is that you’re an animal. A cool kind of animal called the human animal, but an animal nonetheless. You’re a relatively complex machine, but a machine that can be studied and that can be understood. We humans have become incredibly skilled at picking apart the human machine. We have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging" title="wikipedia on fMRI">tools</a> that can see which part of your brain is active during what activity, we even have tools to make the cells in your body glow in the dark when they’re being naughty. We still have much to figure out, but we know an astronomical amount more than we knew 50 years go. The points above are a microscopic example of recently acquired knowledge. Every day, the pile of Stuff We Know is growing more quickly, and the pile of Stuff We Don’t Know is shrinking more quickly. <em>It’s a terribly exciting time to live in.</em></p>
<p>My actual point is: You’ve been given one of these human machines to drive. For life. You’ll be getting only this one, and you’ll be taking it to some strange places, even off-road at times. You’ll make a number of important decisions that deeply affect you and your machine and even the other machines around you.</p>
<p><em>Don’t you think that you should read the manual?</em></p>
