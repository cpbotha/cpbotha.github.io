<p>Since we last connected here, much has transpired, a strangely selected subset
of which is mentioned below:</p>
<h2 id="new-computer">New computer</h2>
<p>An M1 MacBook Air became part of my computing zoo. See <a href="/2021/03/21/new-emacs-capable-hardware-m1-macbook-air/">the new computer post</a> if
you&rsquo;re into that sort of thing. Short version if you&rsquo;re not: It&rsquo;s the best
Emacs-capable device I&rsquo;ve ever used.</p>
<h2 id="pgp-i-m-not-dead-yet">PGP: I&rsquo;m not dead yet!</h2>
<p>In a pleasantly surprising turn of events, I found myself counter-signing PGP
encryption keys with different sets of friends.</p>
<p>In spite of my <a href="/2016/12/11/pgp-never-gonna-give-you-up/">PGP never gonna give you up post</a> of 2016, the thought that
old-fashioned PGP might soon disappear even from my archaic view, to be
replaced by more user-friendly and modern solutions such as <a href="/2016/01/02/when-we-can-lets-use-signal-instead-of-whatsapp/">Signal</a>, has been on
my mind more often recently.</p>
<p>This would not be the worst turn of events. The more people are using secure
and private communication, the better.</p>
<p>However, it <strong>was</strong> fun doing our modest part to bolster the tiny and dwindling
group of humans who know how to use PGP and think that they still should.</p>
<p>All of that being said, we did also make use of the opportunity to perform
defensible <a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007060632-What-is-a-safety-number-and-why-do-I-see-that-it-changed-">Signal safety number verification</a>.</p>
<h2 id="stone-three-healthcare-has-joined-back-up-with-the-rest-of-voltron">Stone Three Healthcare has joined back up with the rest of Voltron</h2>
<p>Back in July of 2019, I <a href="/2019/07/17/weekly-head-voices-173-i-know/#stone-three-healthcare-is-now-a-thing">announced that Stone Three Healthcare had been
officially spun out from Stone Three Venture Technology</a>.</p>
<p>More recently, our corporate mothership embarked on a newly engineered (and
funded) scaling-up journey, bringing with it a host of opportunities for
positive impact on the world.</p>
<p>In the Healthcare company we had to make a choice between sticking it out as a
smaller startup on the one hand, or re-integrating into a newly-designed merged
organization and making use of the extended new capabilities to further our
vision.</p>
<p>(I&rsquo;m really trying to keep it real here, but the line between that and
corp-speak is like mono-filament!)</p>
<p>So, since this past week or so, I&rsquo;m working together with the new merged
entity.</p>
<p>My mandate is now broader in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;ll be focusing on technological solutions for precision Health <strong>and</strong>
Safety, where it was previously healthcare only.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ll be assisting all parts of the company by optimizing technological
processes of all sorts.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is all very exciting to me, and they&rsquo;re even letting me keep some of the
science in my new official title!</p>
<h2 id="the-strange-continuum-of-consciousness">The strange continuum of consciousness</h2>
<p>This is a tricky one to mention, because it probably needs much more space than
I have here, and much more skill than I have to explain.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to try in any case, because just maybe it sparks something for
someone.</p>
<p>A large part of the <a href="https://wakingup.com/">Waking Up meditation</a> daily practice is exploring the exact
nature of one&rsquo;s experienced consciousness.</p>
<p>Specifically, there is the realisation that the whole of your consciousness,
including your thoughts, your interactions with real, live people, and
everything else, takes place in <strong>your</strong> mind.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <em>internal</em> sensations, like an itch, or pain, or a tingling on
your skin, and <em>external</em> sensations, like hearing or sight, although they seem
to be localised <em>inside</em> and <em>outside</em>, take place in the exact same
consciousness.</p>
<p>Everything that you experience, whether &ldquo;real&rdquo;, like looking at the sea, or
imaginary, like thinking about (and hence &ldquo;seeing&rdquo;) something that you need to
take care of tomorrow, or something that you experienced yesterday, are all
simulations that are running as part of your consciousness.</p>
<p>There is a continuum from internal to external, and a continuum from direct
sensory experience to remembered or predicted experience, along with all of its
thoughts and emotions.</p>
<p>These are all the same sort of signals coursing through the same neural
pathways.</p>
<p>Another core idea here is that although your brain is housed in your skull,
your feeling that your consciousness is somehow also localised behind your eyes
is not entirely apt.</p>
<p>Your consciousness is the <em>whole</em> space, with all of your observed reality in
it, <em>including</em> the illusion (or rather simulation) of your localisation.</p>
<p>You (the observer) are not at a single point, but rather everywhere where
consciousness is.</p>
<p>Everything that you perceive to happen, by definition &ldquo;happens&rdquo; in the space
that you call consciousness.</p>
<p>These are tricky lessons to learn, and it seems that at least in my case we are
destined to spend only fleeting moments together, but they have profound and
positive implications for how we go through life.</p>

<p>Recently, Filippo Valsorda, cryptography expert and TLS guy at Cloudflare,
<a href="https://blog.filippo.io/giving-up-on-long-term-pgp/">wrote that he was giving up on PGP, or at least on long term PGP keys</a>.</p>
<p>I agree with many of his points, especially the complexity of managing those
keys, lack of forward secrecy (if someone were to steal my keys, they could
decrypt all past conversations, unlike for example Signal) and accessibility
(how do you verify a message with a baby on your left arm and your telephone
in your right?). More generally, it makes a great deal of sense to make your
security a moving target, <a href="https://twitter.com/FiloSottile/status/807612248223051776">as one of the Ars Technica commenters
astutely summarised Filippo&rsquo;s ideas</a>.</p>
<h2 id="cryptographic-signatures-ftw">Cryptographic signatures FTW</h2>
<p>However, in spite of these factors, I am not yet ready to give up my PGP long-term keys.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p><em>Well, one of the most important uses of my long-term PGP keys is to
cryptographically sign messages that can be verified by people in my network
as having come from my hands.</em></p>
<p>For example, when I change my phone or re-flash its firmware (this has
happened 3 or 4 times over the past two months because Android), I send
PGP-signed messages to my main Signal correspondents with our new safety
numbers.</p>
<p>With all of these correspondents I have in the past either done some sort of
in-person formal PGP signing procedure, or I make use of the web of trust, or
I rely on <a href="https://keybase.io/">keybase</a>. My business cards even
have my key fingerprint on them (yes, I&rsquo;m one of those nerds).</p>
<p>At their ends, the recipients of my messages are able to determine with an
extremely high degree of confidence that <em>I</em> wrote the exact message they
opened.</p>
<h2 id="accessible-pgp-on-your-smartphone-with-openkeychain">Accessible PGP on your smartphone with OpenKeychain</h2>
<p>In terms of accessibility, the post did make me curious enough to experiment
with a mobile PGP solution, as I also did have to agree that I&rsquo;ve in the
past often had to wait until I was behind one of my own laptops or
workstations to PGP-verify a message.</p>
<p>As my one friend explained on Signal:</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tricky to verify a message with a baby in your left hand and a telephone in your right!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.openkeychain.org/">OpenKeychain</a> to the rescue!</p>
<h3 id="strengthen-your-secret-key-encryption">Strengthen your secret key encryption</h3>
<p>Seeing that I was planning on carrying my long-term private keys around on my
telephone (BlackBerry PRIV, FDE encryption active FWIW), I had to double-check
the security of the secret key encryption.</p>
<p>It turns out that PGP encrypts each of your secret keys with a hash of the
passphrase you supply. My passphrase is significantly longer than the average,
and consists of random characters (uppercase, lowercase, numbers,
symbols). Passphrase length and complexity is by far the most important factor
determining the safety of your encrypted secret key.</p>
<p>However, I had the default SHA-1 hash (ouch) with only 64k
iterations. Iterating the hash is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_stretching">key stretching</a>: the
passphrase is hashed, that result is hashed, and so on, for very many times,
so that the testing of each passphrase takes more time, complicating
brute-force cracking approaches.</p>
<p>Inspired by <a href="http://nullprogram.com/blog/2012/06/24/">the writings of
Chris Wellons</a> who keeps his encrypted secret keys on a public website
(!!!), I reconfigured my private key encryption to use 1 million iterations of
the SHA-512 hash, and to use AES-256 for the encryption itself:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#586e75;background-color:#eee8d5;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="display:flex;"><span>gpg --s2k-cipher-algo AES256 --s2k-digest-algo SHA512 --s2k-mode <span style="color:#2aa198;font-weight:bold">3</span> --s2k-count <span style="color:#2aa198;font-weight:bold">1000000</span> --edit-key 384435C7E77A4564
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>After typing that command, enter <code>passwd</code> at the prompt, then
follow the prompts. You will have to enter your passphrase, and then enter
your new passphrase twice.</p>
<p>You can then check that this operation is successful by using the command <code>gpg &ndash;list-packets secring.gpg</code>. My output looks as follows. Most important is that algo is 9 (AES-256), hash is 10 (SHA-512) and protect count in my case is just over 1 million.</p>
<pre><code>:secret key packet:
version 4, algo 1, created 1376407300, expires 0
skey[0]: [4096 bits]
skey[1]: [17 bits]
iter+salt S2K, algo: 9, SHA1 protection, hash: 10, salt: blabla
protect count: 1015808 (
protect IV:
encrypted stuff follows
keyid: 384435C7E77A4564
</code></pre>
<p>SHA-512 is the slowest hash which PGP offers (see <a href="http://thepasswordproject.com/oclhashcat_benchmarking">these oclHashcat
benchmarks for example</a>), which means that each iteration of a brute-force
password cracking attempt will take a bit longer / eat more GPU watts, which
is exactly what we want. You can increase the protect count for as long as the
delay on your smartphone is still tolerable.</p>
<p>However, remember that a stronger and longer passphrase is much better! (so we
do both)</p>
<p>Other than that, remember that <a href="/2016/11/27/android-security-in-2016-is-a-mess/">Android security is far
from good</a>, so do as much as you can to keep your phone safe (keep up with
OS updates, stay away from unofficial app markets, and so on).</p>
<h3 id="use-your-keys-with-openkeychain">Use your keys with OpenKeychain</h3>
<p>I was pleasantly surprised to learn that I could directly import both my
<code>secring.pgp</code> and <code>pubring.gpg</code> files from my
<code>~/.gnupg</code> directory. Right after selecting secring.pgp for import,
the UI looked like this:</p>








<figure><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screenshot_20161209-075007.png">

        /> </a>
</figure>

<p>You can see the old 1024 bit key I made in 2000 to use for my Debian
activities, and the 4096 bit key I currently use.</p>
<p>After importing your secret and public keyring, you are able to encrypt,
decrypt, sign and verify any files or clipboard contents on your Android
phone:</p>








<figure><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screenshot_20161211-170851.png">

        /> </a>
</figure>

<p>So if I receive something like this via Signal:</p>
<pre><code>-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA512

Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry, never gonna say goodbye

-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----
</code></pre>
<p>I long-press, copy the message and then select “read from
clipboard” from OpenKeychain&rsquo;s Encrypt/Decrypt screen, which, if
everything checks out, shows me the following message:</p>








<figure><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screenshot_20161211-202817.png">
    <img

        /> </a>
</figure>

<p>I can now rest assured that <a href="http://mentat.za.net/">this
specific buddy of mine</a> is never gonna give me up and is never gonna let me
down.</p>
<p>Cryptographically signing a message is equally easy, except that you&rsquo;ll
have to enter that long passphrase of yours. OpenKeychain will then make the
signed and optionally encrypted text text available for sharing to any app, or
for copying and pasting:</p>








<figure><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screenshot_20161211-174458.png">
    <img

        /> </a>
</figure>

<p>Easy peasy, and tested under all sorts of usually-PGP-unfriendly conditions!</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Maintaining PGP long-term keys certainly has its issues, but the possibility
of cryptographically signing any message so that recipients can establish with
high confidence that it originated from you is too important to give up.</p>
<p>With an app like OpenKeychain and sufficiently strong passphrase hashing and
secret key encryption, you are able to use your keys with ease from your
telephone.</p>
<p>Granted, you are trading in some security for this convenience. However, given
the choice between discarding my PGP keys completely, vs. taking these steps,
I&rsquo;ll hold on to my keys for a little while longer.</p>
<p>In order to mitigate the potential damage of one of my long-term keys being
compromised, I have resolved to generate and start using a new private key as
soon as I run through my current batch of business cards, and to continue
rotating like this in the future.</p>
<p>Let me know in the comments what you think. Do you know of a better
alternative for remotely verifying the identity and messages of your
correspondents?</p>

<p>It turns out that government agencies are allowed to extract, at a whim, your and my data from service providers, such as Google, Microsoft and Yahoo. There is no real legal process (unless you can call a secret judge in a secret court giving a secret order a real legal process), <em>especially</em> if you’re not a US citizen, and the providers that have been forced to give up your data in this way are not allowed to notify you about your digital self being violated. So even if they <em>say</em> that you shouldn’t worry, <em>you can never be entirely sure</em>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it has also been revealed that the NSA has for years being acquiring encryption keys via legal (secretly forcing companies to give them the keys) and extra-legal (simply hacking into company servers) means. Even worse, they have for years been deliberately introducing security weaknesses into software products and encryption software in order to be able to crack open your data even more easily.</p>
<p>You can read more about this state of affairs in <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/the-nsa-files" title="The Guardian NSA files">The Guardian’s NSA files</a>. The Guardian has been doing a sterling job of analysing and bringing to light the depths to which our governments have sunk. There’s a whole lot of information, and most of it is quite upsetting.</p>
<p>For me the final straw was when secure email service <a href="http://lavabit.com/" title="lavabit website with close-down message">lavabit</a> voluntarily shut itself down, when faced with the prospect of being forced to leak user information to the US government without being allowed to tell anyone. The message on the site is quite chilling, and concludes with the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This experience has taught me one very important lesson: without congressional action or a strong judicial precedent, I would <em>strongly</em> recommend against anyone trusting their private data to a company with physical ties to the United States.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this point, I was a super happy and pretty heavy user of a number of US-based services, including GMail (all my email, about 40000 conversations consisting of 60000 mails, that’s excluding my work email which I also hosted on GMail), Google+ Photos (all my photos, about 21000 of ’em), Google Drive, Dropbox (50G of data spread out over 120000 files). <em>In all cases, I still consider these to be best of class services.</em> In putting my money where my mouth is, I was paying both Google and Dropbox for extra storage.</p>
<p>I also had no problem with Google filtering through my email to show me targeted advertising. This is the deal I had with them. I also had no problem with the possibility of someone getting my data after due legal process. However, the idea that some NSA or other government agency flunky could quite easily stick their grubby paws into my data, and that I would never know about this, was too much.</p>
<p>There’s probably nothing much of interest in my data. However, it has become a matter of principle; Privacy is a basic human right. <a href="http://www.wired.com/politics/security/commentary/securitymatters/2006/05/70886" title="value of privacy by Bruce Schneier">Here’s an old essay by Bruce Schneier</a> if you need to read more about why privacy is so important.</p>
<p>In short: <strong>It was time to extricate all of my lovely data from probably well-meaning US companies, thanks to the ridiculously powerful and secretive NSA, and thanks to all of its shadowy counterparts around the world.</strong></p>
<p>Here’s how I did it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Considered building another low-cost Linux server, or even a Raspberry Pi. Decided against this due to time required for configuration and acquired a Synology DS213j NAS, which is at this moment standing on the desk about 1 metre to my left. My recommendation: Just get this, you won’t be sorry.</li>
<li>Downloaded 60000 emails to Synology using Thunderbird mail client. Deleted everything from GMail. Google engineers assure me that after a few months, data will <em>really</em> be gone.</li>
<li>My webhoster (<a href="https://www.webfaction.com/">WebFaction</a>) receives mail for all my domains. My Synology retrieves mail every 5 minutes via POP (you can set this up via Roundcube on the Synology) and deletes it from WebFaction.</li>
<li>Outgoing mail is relayed by the Synology via the WebFaction SMTP server. I don’t have to worry too much about blacklisting and whatnot, my hoster does this.</li>
<li>I’m back to interacting with my mail using Thunderbird and IMAP SSL. The loss of GMail conversation view was initially really REALLY painful. People have forgotten the ancient art of quoting. However, I’ve configured Thunderbird to archive all mail to year-stamped archive folders, and to put my sent mail there. Poor-man’s Conversation View! (the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/thunderbird/addon/gmail-conversation-view/">conversations plugin</a> is wonky. it’s shocking how much the availability of GMail, which works really well, has stunted the development of alternative email clients) Importantly, I am now able to use <a href="http://www.openpgp.org/">OpenPGP</a> again for the strong encryption and cryptographic signing of my emails.</li>
<li>On my Android telephone (whoops…) I am using <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kaitenmail&amp;hl=en" title="Kaiten email on the Google Play store">the Kaiten IMAP client</a>.</li>
<li>All the data I had in Dropbox is now being synced between the Synology, two laptops and a workstation using <a href="http://labs.bittorrent.com/experiments/sync.html" title="bittorrent sync">BitTorrent Sync</a>. This peer-to-peer syncing system is still a little rough around the edges, but falls squarely in the category of “Best Things Since Sliced Bread”, and it’s <em>FAST</em>. CloudStation, Synology’s dropbox-inspired solution, was just far too slow on my Synology model.</li>
<li>My photos (21000 of them) have been downloaded from Google+ Photos (thank you <a href="https://www.google.com/takeout/" title="Google Takeout">Google Takeout</a>) and are now being served from the Synology using PhotoStation.</li>
<li>My music (5400+ tracks) is downloading from Google Music as we speak, and will be served from the Synology using AudioStation.</li>
<li>I make incremental backups of everything to an encrypted external USB drive, using <a href="http://www.dirvish.org/" title="dirvish website">dirvish</a>. I will probably add an extra external drive to the mix and try to keep that off site.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s been an interesting process moving my stuff out, and getting used to these alternative systems is sometimes slightly uncomfortable, but I am quite happy with the end result. I hope that more people will take this step, and I really hope that more and easier-to-use alternatives for secure email (such as <a href="http://www.mailpile.is/" title="mailpile website">mailpile</a>) and for ubiquitous private data will become available.</p>
<h1 id="addendum-2013-09-16">Addendum 2013-09-16</h1>
<p>My <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6392322">submission of this post</a> spent some time on the Hacker News front page, and from there was <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1mhpqj/dear_usa_my_data_has_left_your_building/">picked up by reddit</a> as well. This brought many comments, a number of which were positive and thoughtful, and a number of which that were far less so. It’s amazing how anonymity and comment sections can bring out the worst in people. (if you have to know, the Hacker News community is generally MILES more polite than reddit)</p>
<p>In any case, I wanted to clarify an issue or two: After moving my data away from GMail and Dropbox, I am not under any impression that my data is now secure. I can still be hacked. My hardware and software could be full of backdoors. My email will still be read as it jumps from server to server, probably ending up in someone else’s GMail. :) However, if more people were to move their data out to their own premises, it becomes more complicated and costly for government agencies to monitor us all. At the moment, the NSA cuts deals with a few large email and other cloud service providers, and with that they’re able to monitor large swathes of users. However, if more of those users were to move away, many more deals have to be cut and servers hacked, costing more time and more money. Add to that increased used of OpenPGP (which I do use, and mention in my post), and it becomes even more difficult. I know that I’m just a drop in a bucket, but hey, at least I am a drop in a bucket!</p>
<p>My goal with posting this was to show that it’s relatively easy to move much of your data away. I have the feeling that many of the most impolite anonymous commenters still store their data with cloud providers, and would really prefer to believe that there are no worthwhile alternatives, hence all the ad hominem attacks.</p>
<p>Fortunately, each polite and humane comment makes up for a whole pile of bad ones. :)</p>
