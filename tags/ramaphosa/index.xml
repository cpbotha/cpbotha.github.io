<p>This edition of the Weekly Head Voices, number two tenny eight, covers the
period of time from Monday June 28 to Sunday July 18 of the year 2021.</p>
<h2 id="bad-glitch-in-the-south-african-matrix">Bad glitch in the South African matrix</h2>
<p>Although I don&rsquo;t have much to say here (hence <a href="https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Komkommertijd">the title</a>), the country has been
all over the news for less than great reasons.</p>
<p>Shortly after former president Zuma finally finally handed himself over to the
police on Sunday July 4 to serve his 15 month jail sentence for contempt of the
Constitutional court (there are more cases to come), looting, arson and
violence broke out primarily in Kwazulu-Natal, but also in Gauteng.</p>
<p>Various shopes and malls have been stripped bare and/or destroyed.</p>
<p>This looked like a perfect storm, initiated by Zuma&rsquo;s incarceration (he has a
great deal of support in Kwazulu-Natal), partially fanned on by his children
and allies on social media, and intensified by systemic poverty.</p>
<p>There were many videos on social media of folks with luxury items, some trying
to stuff flat-screen TVs into their cars, or crossing the street with a basket
full of goods to dump in their luxury Mercedes, but there were also many more
who are only trying to survive under the poverty line and can&rsquo;t be blamed for
any of this.</p>
<p>As far as I can see, our current president Ramaphosa has for years now been
doing his best to unravel the nest of corruption and dishonesty that his party
the ANC has unfortunately become.</p>
<p>This is tricky work, as he needs to circumnavigate and/or defuse the same
internal forces that managed to oust president Thabo Mbeki and usher in the
terrible era of Zuma.</p>
<p>The poor man has had to endure even more flak in these days, both from his
political enemies and from other commentators.</p>
<p>Until convincingly shown otherwise, my opinion is that president Ramaphosa is
the best shot we currently have at a better future.</p>
<p>You can read <a href="https://www.gov.za/speeches/president-cyril-ramaphosa-update-security-situation-country-16-jul-2021-0000">his July 16 speech about the unrest here</a>.</p>
<p>A slight silver edge is that these events have put more pressure on the
<a href="https://businesstech.co.za/news/finance/506914/government-considers-basic-income-grant-after-riots-and-looting-in-south-africa/">discussions around the possible implementation of a basic income grant</a>.</p>
<p>P.S. It seems that the looting was not disruptive enough for some folks, and so
now we are dealing with <a href="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2021-07-20-why-the-western-cape-is-being-rocked-by-taxi-violence/">taxi-company-related violence in the Western Cape</a>.</p>
<p>P.P.S. let me just hide this here: far more locally, we are dealing with some
pandemic-related stressors.</p>
<h2 id="reserve-bench-holidays">Reserve bench holidays</h2>
<p>As <a href="/2021/06/30/weekly-head-voices-227-reality-bending-security-blanket/#groundhog-lockdown">I supected in the previous WHV</a> (three weeks ago, ahem&hellip;), our country&rsquo;s
struggles with the pandemic did in fact manage to get our Kruger National Park
visit cancelled.</p>
<p>To be clear, I have no illusions about the relative importance of our holiday
under these circumstances and in this context (close to utterly unimportant, in
other words), but we humans are gonna human and I&rsquo;m not gonna lie, we were
really looking forward to that week of sun in Mpumalanga.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve often said that the winter down here is more bearable than one would
expect, due to it being quite often punctuated by brilliant and sunny days
outside, but this year I&rsquo;ve come to realise that I might have underestimated
the positive effects of <a href="/tags/knp/">spending the darkest week under the sun of the North</a>.</p>
<p>Anyways, we were super fortunate to be able to arrange for a long weekend in
another one of our favourite places, namely Wilderness, where we were treated
with absolutely balmy days, some of them on the Touw river (inflatable SUPs
FTW!), some of them on the most beautiful beaches, and some of them hiking and
running on various trails.</p>

<p>If it sounds to you like we had to go outside every day to warm up in the
winter sun, I can hereby confirm your astute observation.</p>
<p>To be fair, this was literally in the deepest part of winter, from which there
is no true escape if one remains within the Western Cape.</p>
<p>In spite of that, or perhaps because of it, we enjoyed the wonderful days to
bits.</p>

<p>Greetings, fellow humans!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 16:15 (UTC+2) on Sunday afternoon as I sit here writing this.</p>
<p>The post seems to be mostly planned out, with fragments of text strewn around
the editor window right below this sentence.</p>
<p>With sheer luck, I&rsquo;ve managed to find music that interacts well with my current
mood trajectory (finding <em>the right music</em> seems like a truly hard problem),
and at this moment I&rsquo;m still hopeful that I might also have found <a href="/tags/pomodoro/">one whole
pomodoro</a> to work with here.</p>
<p>We are living through some of the most surrealistic times I have ever
experienced.</p>
<p>For friends, for other curious observers and for posterity I think it&rsquo;s now an
even better idea than usual to write down at least some of my observations.</p>
<p>On that note, the older I get, the more clearly I see how the idea of a unified
&ldquo;I&rdquo; going through life is nothing more than an illusion, albeit seemingly
well-made.</p>
<p>In 2014 I <a href="/2014/05/07/weekly-head-voices-70-patterns-in-the-sand/">wrote about us being patterns continuously shifting in the sands of
the universe</a>.</p>
<p>Back then, at least if I can go by my writing, it was a dawning
realisation. Now it has become Captain Obvious territory.</p>
<p>ANYWAYS</p>
<p>In this post, I look back at the period of time from Wednesday March 25 to
Sunday April 11.</p>
<h2 id="lockdown-extension">Lockdown extension.</h2>
<p>The South African national lockdown started at midnhight on Thursday, March 26
and would continue for three weeks until April 16.</p>
<p>Of course this virus wasn&rsquo;t magically going to give up and go home after
exactly three weeks.</p>
<p>Just like everyone else, we were only buying time, and I&rsquo;m super happy that we
started when we did.</p>
<p>We know <em>much</em> more now than we knew then. In three weeks more, we&rsquo;ll know even
more.</p>
<p>Whatever the case may be, I&rsquo;ve never before seen the whole of South Africa work
together this well.</p>
<p>There is certaintly some dissent, but by and large the measures seem to be
working, and the curve looks like it is flattening for us.</p>
<p>(There will <em>of course</em> be those, as there always are, who will claim that it
was all much ado about nothing&hellip;)</p>
<p>Although we sort of saw it coming, it was still quite something hearing on
Friday evening, April 10, that the national lockdown would be extended to April
30.</p>
<h2 id="masks4all">#Masks4All</h2>
<p>On March 30, I &ldquo;joined&rdquo; the twitter #masks4all campaign by doing my little bit
to try and convince people everywhere that if <strong>all</strong> of us started wearing
home-made (the good stuff is for the healthcare workers yo!) masks as a rule,
it would contribute substantially to preventing the virus from spreading.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">South Africans, how do

<p>I find this extra important, because it could play a really important role,
together with physical distancing, hand-washing and more, in how we end the
lockdown safely and get our already-less-than-robust economy back up and
running.</p>
<p>At the start it felt like no-one was listening, and I was getting anxious.</p>
<p>SOMEONE WAS WRONG ON THE INTERNET, AND THIS TIME IT WAS SERIOUS!</p>
<p>It really did not help that the <a href="https://www.westerncape.gov.za/gc-news/147/54065">official line of the Western Cape Health
Department on March 29 was warning <em>against</em> masks and
gloves</a>. (I&rsquo;ve archived the
statement in case anyone loses it.)</p>
<p>The point that many people were utterly missing at that point but that is
hopefully now embarrassingly obvious, is that the mask is not there to protect
the wearer, it&rsquo;s there to help protect <em>everyone else</em> from being infected by the
wearer.</p>
<p>Fast-forward a week or so (an eternity in COVID-19 time) to April 10, and South
Africa&rsquo;s very own and very respected health minister Dr Zweli Mkhize started
tweeting the new official line that the department of health now also
recommends that everyone wears cloth masks:</p>

<p>See the great <a href="https://masks4all.co/">#masks4all.co</a> for more information.</p>
<p>My (microscopic little) work here is done.</p>
<h2 id="work-exercise-and-the-future-in-captivity">Work, exercise and the future, in captivity.</h2>
<h3 id="remote-work">Remote work.</h3>
<p>In <a href="/2020/03/24/weekly-head-voices-191-covid-19-part-1/#outlook">the previous
WHV</a>, I might have
mentioned remote work once or twice.</p>
<p>Well, since then it feels like I&rsquo;ve spent at least three and a half years
working remotely, hard.</p>
<p>I underestimated the amount of automatic, implicit, in-person communication
that happens when you&rsquo;re at the office.</p>
<p>All of that currently has to happen via various video meetings, instant
messenging, emails, and then many more instant messages during the rest of the
day.</p>
<p>In its new form, all of this communication takes quite an amount of time and
energy. It feels like I can only bunker down late morning to start on the
actual work.</p>
<p>(Microsoft Teams is our tool for all of this. Whilst it&rsquo;s not perfect, it has
been serving us quite well.)</p>
<p>In spite of the feeling that communication is taking up significantly more time
and energy, my perception is that, over-all, we engineers get a lot more done
in this new configuration.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I am hopeful that continued practice will reduce the perceived
additional communication effort.</p>
<h3 id="exercise">Exercise.</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s not allowed to leave the house even for exercise, and so my running has
taken quite a hit.</p>
<p>I have had to resort to running circles around the house for half an hour at a
time, which, in spite of me usually really enjoying the monotony of
road-running, is quite a challenge.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are people who are stuck in apartments and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/21/man-runs-marathon-on-7-metre-balcony-during-french-lockdown">then run
42km on the
balcony</a>,
and there&rsquo;s even the South African <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/southafrica/comments/fzvtak/south_african_runner_from_george_runs_100_miles/">Eddie Mouton who ran 160km in his
yard</a>.</p>
<p>The elliptical trainer which we bought on July 31 of 2007 (it&rsquo;s the FINNLO
crosstrainer 3252), and for the almost 13 years since then has been nothing
more than an overpriced clothing and towel hanger, has seen more actual
exercise use in the past weeks than during its whole lifetime up to now.</p>
<p>One great upshot of all of this is that we more often train together, or at
least close enough for a high-five now and then.</p>
<h3 id="the-future">The future.</h3>
<p>As I alluded to in the previous <a href="/2020/03/24/weekly-head-voices-191-covid-19-part-1/#outlook">WHV
#191</a>, and
especially as the lockdown has now been extended, giving us even more time to
practise and build habits, I would really like to know how much of what we
learn and experience now is going to stick in the post-covid-19-era?</p>
<p>Noticing how we have to pay much more attention to how exactly we communicate,
realising how much work can actually be fit into a day without too many
interruptions, and seeing how quickly nature uses this time to recover from our
normally incessant onslaught, all lead me to think that we should not stop
analysing and discussing the changes that COVID-19 has brought.</p>
<p>Do you think we&rsquo;ll just flip back to the old normal as soon as we (hopefully)
get through this, or do you think we can look forward to a slightly upgraded
humanity?</p>
<h2 id="thats-all-folks">That&rsquo;s all folks!</h2>
<p>Because this post had already grown substantially larger than I had intended, I
just removed two whole subsections, the beefiest one about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann">Niklas
Luhmann</a> and <a href="https://writingcooperative.com/zettelkasten-how-one-german-scholar-was-so-freakishly-productive-997e4e0ca125">his amazing
Zettelkästen / external
brain</a>.</p>
<p>Do not fear, they&rsquo;ll probably make an appearance in a subsequent WHV, or
perhaps even separate posts.</p>
<p>As some of you might have read previously on this blog, the struggle in my head
between these longer form mish-mash-life-snapshot WHV posts on the one hand and
more topic-focused shorter posts on the other has been going on for years, and
will hopefully continue for years more.</p>
<p>(I say hopefully, because that means I might still be posting as well.)</p>
<p>This specific thought is still developing, but I might be starting an
experiment where I do try to write some shorter, more focused posts.</p>
<p>I will keep you up to date!</p>
<p>Ok reader, whoever and wherever you are, I wish you the very best that humanity
has to offer!</p>

<p>Welcome back everyone! I hope all of you are doing as well as possible.</p>
<p>This edition of the WHV looks back on the two and a bit tumultuous weeks from
Monday March 9 to Tuesday March 24.</p>
<p>I am writing this for us here now, but I&rsquo;m also writing this for readers in a
few years&rsquo; time who might be looking into the more obscure corners of the web
for additional impressions of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>(It is now 7:32 on Tuesday morning, March 24, 2020. Last night we had the
<a href="https://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/sa-on-coronavirus-lockdown-read-president-cyril-ramaphosas-full-speech-45429127">rattling national lockdown
announcement</a>,
and now it&rsquo;s the morning after.)</p>
<h2 id="the-build-up">The build-up.</h2>
<p>All of this escalated quite quickly.</p>
<p>It seems like ages ago, but my first covid-related retweet was on
February 27. It was this tweet of the study of the effect of different
hand-to-hand configurations on infectious disease transmission (hint: fist bump
beats handshake by far):</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;Adoption of the fist bump as a greeting could substantially reduce the transmission of infectious disease between individuals.&quot;<br><br>I will be doing more fist bumps until the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/coronavirus?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#coronavirus</a> passes. Please RT if you want to make this a social norm. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SPSP2020?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SPSP2020</a><a href="https://t.co/Fk1ekBr3FP">https://t.co/Fk1ekBr3FP</a> <a href="https://t.co/TlMbB9UWyZ">pic.twitter.com/TlMbB9UWyZ</a></p>&mdash; Jay Van Bavel (@jayvanbavel) <a href="https://twitter.com/jayvanbavel/status/1233133292226064396?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 27, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>After that, I started spending more and more time on twitter, which has proven
to be a fantastic source of up to date information, if, as always, you apply
discipline to the care and culling of your follows.</p>
<p>Since then I&rsquo;ve been retweeting as many of the important tidbits as I could:</p>
<h3 id="lets-first-get-the-naming-right">Let&rsquo;s first get the naming right.</h3>
<p>The disease is called coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the virus is called
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).</p>
<p>See <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/naming-the-coronavirus-disease-(covid-2019)-and-the-virus-that-causes-it">this page on the WHO&rsquo;s
site</a>.</p>
<h3 id="flattening-the-curve">Flattening the curve.</h3>
<p>Flattening the curve was, and still is at this point in time, our best hope to
get through the pandemic.</p>
<p>Physical distancing is how we do this.</p>
<p>That is, we keep enough physical distance between us and other humans that the
virus has almost no chance of transmitting.</p>
<p>The media calls this &ldquo;social distancing&rdquo;, but in the age of internet and video
and smartphones, the distance does not have to be social!</p>
<p>(March 24, 2018, 7:35: <a href="https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1240312329092444162">It seems that
the</a> WHO has also been
using &ldquo;physical distancing&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;social distancing&rdquo;.)</p>
<p>By doing this, we buy time by ensuring that our hospital systems are not
overloaded. Time means that we learn more about the virus, time means that
humanity can discover more methods of prevention and treatment.</p>
<p>Remote work is, and should be, the new normal for any industries where this is
at all possible.</p>
<p>(Even when we&rsquo;re not right in the middle of a pandemic, why is remote working
NOT the normal-normal?)</p>
<p>At Stone Three it feels like we went from normal to the new remote-normal in an
instant.</p>
<p>We recently migrated from GSuite to Office365. Our migration to Microsoft Teams
for a large part of the communication has gone pretty well, in spite of Teams
showing some technical hiccups in that first week when <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-teams-coronavirus-daily-active-users-2020-3?IR=T">they onboarded 12
MILLION new
users</a>.</p>
<h3 id="good-old-fashioned-soap-is-virus-kryptonite">Good old-fashioned soap is virus Kryptonite.</h3>
<p>See <a href="https://twitter.com/PalliThordarson/status/1236549305189597189">this twitter thread by Palli
Thordarson</a>.</p>
<p>Most viruses, including our current nemesis SARS-CoV-2, are &ldquo;self-assembled nanoparticles&rdquo; with a &ldquo;lipid (fatty) bilayer&rdquo; as the outside shell.</p>
<p>Good old-fashioned soap dissolves the fat membrane and the virus simply falls apart.</p>
<p>AMAZING!</p>
<p>We have bars of soap everywhere in my house now, and we vigorously wash hands
at regular intervals.</p>
<h2 id="sht-gets-real-in-mzansi">Sh*t gets real in Mzansi.</h2>
<p>AfrikaBurn was cancelled on Friday March 13.</p>
<p>This year our theme camp was going to consist of a whole 14 people (9 from NL),
up from 7 in previous years.</p>
<p>Everyone on the small BURNIVERSITY WhatsApp group was gutted by this news, but
it was crystal clear to all of us that cancelling the burn was really the only
defensible position.</p>
<h3 id="state-of-disaster-announcement">State of disaster announcement.</h3>
<p>Then on the evening of Sunday March 15, it got a whole lot more real when our
president Ramaphosa announced on the television that South Africa was
officially in a state of disaster.</p>
<p>The following measures were announced:</p>
<ul>
<li>Travel ban of foreign nationals from high risk countries, including USA and the EU.</li>
<li>All foreign nationals who have recently arrived are to be tested.</li>
<li>SA citizens returning from high risk countries to be tested and isolated.</li>
<li>Gatherings of 100 or more prohibited.</li>
<li>Schools closed from March 18.</li>
</ul>
<p>The text of the full speech can be <a href="https://sacoronavirus.co.za/2020/03/15/statement-by-president-cyril-ramaphosa-on-measures-to-combat-covid-19-epidemic/">read on
sacoronavirus.co.za</a>.</p>
<p>Before the speech I still had the feeling that I might be over-reacting by
starting to work remotely, and suggesting strongly that others do so too, and
by considering taking my children out of school.</p>
<p>Those feelings were evaporated by Ramaphosa&rsquo;s chilling but necessary speech.</p>
<h3 id="national-lockdown-announcement">National lockdown announcement.</h3>
<p>On the evening of Monday, March 23, we were again waiting for an announcement
by the president.</p>
<p>Personally, I thought it was going to be all about the measures the government
was planning to take to safeguard the South African economy during these times.</p>
<p>Those indeed were announced, and they sound good to me.</p>
<p>However, the president also <a href="https://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/sa-on-coronavirus-lockdown-read-president-cyril-ramaphosas-full-speech-45429127">announced a <em>national
lockdown</em></a>
starting at midnight on Thursday March 26 and continuing for three weeks.</p>
<p>All businesses, except those involved in essential services, will be closed.</p>
<p>Everyone, except those involved in essential services, will have to stay at
home.</p>
<p>People will be able to leave their homes to buy food or seek medical care.</p>
<h2 id="outlook">Outlook.</h2>
<p>At this moment (7:52, day after lockdown announcement evening) I am reeling
just a little bit.</p>
<p>I think our government and especially the president have been doing a truly
stellar job of responding to this crisis. Based on past and recent experience
with the government, this did come as a bit of a surprise.</p>
<p>I was pretty happy with how we&rsquo;d adapted to the physical distancing situation,
but then the lockdown announcement happened.</p>
<p>Although I am convinced that this too was the best response, I am worried about
how it&rsquo;s going to impact the economy at large and, far more acutely, how it&rsquo;s
going to impact the businesses and people right around me.</p>
<p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/MichaelJordaan/status/1242332234297872384">Like many
others</a>, I am
super impressed by Ramaphosa&rsquo;s calm and decisive leadership during this
crisis.)</p>
<p>The only thing <em>we</em> can do now, is to do our absolute best.</p>
<p>On a similar positive note, it seems like COVID-19 is teaching humanity a
number of important lessons of which I really hope many of them stick:</p>
<ol>
<li>We don&rsquo;t really need to travel as much as we do. (sorry airlines, but it&rsquo;s
true.)</li>
<li>It is entirely possible for a great deal more of people to work remotely,
and hence spend less time and carbon output on the road.</li>
<li>When we focus right, this internet thing we built can be used for so much
good.</li>
<li>Now that we&rsquo;re all faced with the same enemy, we look a <em>whole lot</em> more
similar that we normally do.</li>
</ol>
<p>I wish you all the best during these times.</p>
<p>Remember: From up close to all the way around the globe, kindness is effective
across all distances!</p>

<p>We have a serious deadline coming up on Tuesday, so I’m going to make these few WHV minutes count.</p>
<p>BULLET LIST TO THE RESCUE!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Day zero has again been <a href="https://mg.co.za/article/2018-02-13-day-zero-pushed-back-to-june-as-drought-declared-a-national-disaster/">postponed, this time to June 4</a>. We continue with our water saving efforts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That <a href="/2018/02/11/weekly-head-voices-131-function-over-form/#tool-belts-for-humanity">unexpected side-project I mentioned in last week’s post</a> did end up going live that very night. Armed with the Django Rest Framework and plenty of battle scars, it took about 17 hours from idea to fully deployed REST API, a large part of which was debugging the paper’s math and spreadsheets.</p>
<ul>
<li>Django might be a slow runner relative to some of the other kids on the block (go with any of its web frameworks, nginx with openresty (lua right in your web server!), even apistar with uvicorn), but the completeness and maturity of Django and its ginormous ecosystem are hard to beat when it comes to development velocity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>There’s a <a href="http://takingnotenow.blogspot.co.za/">whole blog on the nature of note-taking</a>. I arrived there via <a href="https://github.com/rudolfochrist/interleave">interleave</a> and <a href="https://github.com/weirdNox/org-noter">org-noter</a>, both emacs packages for keeping text (orgmode) notes synchronised with PDFs, both found via <a href="http://irreal.org/blog/?p=6954">irreal</a>, a great Emacs blog.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the extra lessons I have with GOU#1, we studied electrical current from basic (atomic) principles. As I was getting all excited about the outer electrons being passed on from copper atom to copper atom (Khan Academy and I tag team these lessons), GOU#1 had to laugh at the goose flesh on my arms.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Khan Academy lecture seemed to imply that Benjamin Franklin started us down the not-quite-correct path of conventional current (from positive to negative), whereas the electrons being passed on imply current flow from negative to positive, aka electron current. However, <a href="https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/17131">this physics StackOverflow answer</a> more completely explains that current is defined as <em>the flow of electric charge</em>, with electron flow being one example, and hence both directions are correct.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>To be honest, I became ever so slightly irritated with an episode of one of my favourite podcasts, CPPCast, as the guest said “like” so often that I had trouble following what he was <em>actually</em> like trying to say. This like led me to using Google’s machine-learning-based speech to text API one night to like transcribe the audio of the podcast to speech so that I could like count the number of like utterances. There were not as many as I thought, but still a whole lot. If you’re curious as to the stats, I wrote everything up in <a href="https://vxlabs.com/2018/02/15/use-the-google-cloud-speech-api-to-transcribe-a-podcast/">this nerdy vxlabs blog post</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>On the topic of note-taking: Because I make lab notes of everything in my Emacs, including late night speech recognition experiments, publishing a blog post is a question of some copy pasting, and then telling Emacs to publish to the blog.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>On Thursday, some dudes came to my house and, after somehow switching seamlessly from pick-axe to optic fibre splicer and back several times, left me with this (and more):

<p>These are strange Gibson-esque times when there’s now permanently a laser transmitting all of these packets to you via the network of glass strands encircling the Earth, whilst many of us are still struggling to grasp the difference between fact and fiction.</p>

<p>We have a new president: President <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyril_Ramaphosa">Cyril Ramaphosa!</a> He was Mandela’s choice to become president of this country, but it was Thabo’s turn, and then things went pear-shaped with Zuma. Years later, the situation is quite dire, but so far there are many indications that Ramaphosa has the makings of a great leader (I have become convinced that we humans, all of us, need great leaders to advance as humanity; I hope to write a post about that some day). After Friday’s state of the nation (SONA) address by present Ramaphosa, I, along with many fellow South Africans, are hopeful for our future.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Ok peeps, have a wonderful week! I’ll see you NEXT TIME!</p>
