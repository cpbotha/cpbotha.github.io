<p>Thanks to COVID-19, many organizations and their their workers have had to
fast-track their previously hypothetical plans and dreams to adopt remote
working.</p>
<p>Where this was once a long-running debate with a handful of more progressive
companies actually executing, all of a sudden many of us found ourselves
working from home, including spending significant parts of our day in video
meetings.</p>
<p>Less commuting, less polluting and much more flexibility in how one achieves
work-life balance are amazing benefits.</p>
<p>However, it almost feels like we have to meet, albeit virtually, more than ever
before. Add to that the constantly busy office chat (Teams, Slack, Mattermost,
and many more offerings) with its groups and private chats, and the day can be
quite exhausting even before doing the actual work that is discussed in all of
these meetings.</p>
<p>Now just imagine that there was a way to skip most of those meetings, and to
keep the office chat only for social reasons.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t that be great?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that there is an important missing ingredient to making
exactly that happen.</p>
<p>The missing ingredient is called <em>asynchronous communication</em>.</p>
<p>With a bit of discipline and some good expectation setting, the application of
<em>real-time sometimes, asynchronous most of the time</em> will lead to a
more efficient, better documented and, importantly, a far less stressful remote
workplace.</p>
<p>To be clear, <em>real-time sometimes, asynchronous most of the time</em> makes a great
deal of sense also in non-remote work settings.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-asynchronous-communication">What is asynchronous communication?</h2>
<p>The following is an extended version of the definitions from the company
<a href="https://blog.doist.com/asynchronous-communication/">Doist&rsquo;s blog post on the topic</a>.</p>
<h3 id="synchronous">Synchronous</h3>
<p>Synchronous communication is sending a message and <em>expecting</em> the recipient to
process the information and respond <em>immediately</em>.</p>
<p>A meeting is a pretty intensive form of this.</p>
<p>You say something, and I usually have to respond on the spot.</p>
<p>In many cases, email is also treated as synchronous communication.</p>
<p>You hear that notification ping, so you stop whatever you&rsquo;re doing and you
check the email.</p>
<p>Whether you answer immediately or not, you have succeeded in losing
concentration on your main task.</p>
<h3 id="asynchronous">Asynchronous</h3>
<p>Asynchronous communication is sending a message without <em>expecting</em> an
immediate response.</p>
<p>For example, you send me an email, and because our workplace policy sets these
expectations, I can respond thoughtfully and in depth, in a few hours, during
the following day or even later.</p>
<p>A more modern asynchronous communication tool would be the company discussion
forum, or online project management system, where thoughtful and usually longer
form messages can be <em>contextually</em> posted, that is, close to the project or
task they pertain to.</p>
<p>These messages can be read by all relevant colleagues, and discussed in the
comments.</p>
<p>A key idea here is that all communication happens asynchronously, with each
colleague taking time to think and to respond when it best fits their schedule.</p>
<p>Please see <a href="#gitlab-async-mindset-test">Gitlab&rsquo;s anynchronous mindset test</a> below.</p>
<p>An additional advantage of this method is that all of these discussions and
decisions are by default perfectly documented, can be shared with future
colleagues, and can even be surfaced later via intranet search.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-disadvantages-of-a-synchronous-communication-environment">What are the disadvantages of a synchronous communication environment?</h2>
<p>The following four problems that occur due to a synchronous communication
environment are paraphrased from the <a href="https://blog.doist.com/asynchronous-communication/">Doist post</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Constant interruptions</dt>
<dd>Each notification of each incoming message breaks
concentration to such an extent that people will have a hard time making
progress on the sort of valuable work that requires blocks of focus. Apart
from the immediate break, there is also the aggregate effect of all of the
day&rsquo;s interruptions which cause a great deal of unnecessary mental cycles
that could have been spent on deep work.</dd>
<dt>It becomes more important to be connected than to be productive</dt>
<dd>In such
environments, it becomes a priority to be available when someone pings
you. All energy is now diverted from valuable work into being available and
reactive.</dd>
<dt>More stress</dt>
<dd>Instead of setting their own schedules, and determining how
most of their day can be productively spent, workers spend their days
reacting to incoming messages, hence losing control of their schedules.</dd>
<dt>Lower quality discussions and sub-optimal solutions</dt>
<dd>An immediate response
is expected, especially during a meeting, so there&rsquo;s no time to come up with
a thoughtful and in-depth response.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In addition to these, there is the issue that synchronous communication further
complicates good organizational documentation and knowledge management.</p>
<p>When meetings are minuted, those minutes are brief notes of a third party who
does their best to capture the gist of the meeting.</p>
<p>However, when the &ldquo;meeting&rdquo; takes place in writing in the first place, the
documentation is by construction the most canonical description.</p>
<p>Group chat messages can be stored and indexed, but due to the nature of the
medium, namely large collections of many short messages most of which are
understandably chatter, this is a not a great way to have in depth discussions
or document decisions.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-advantages-of-an-asynchronous-communication-environment">What are the advantages of an asynchronous communication environment?</h2>
<p>The following is paraphrased from <a href="https://blog.doist.com/asynchronous-communication/">Doist</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Workers schedule their workday</dt>
<dd>With fewer to no meetings or other
synchronous communication expected, workers have full control over when they
do their work, which leads to greater work satisfaction and higher quality
work. Furthermore, struggling to find a meeting time that in the packed
agendas of all participants is a problem of the past.</dd>
<dt>High quality communication vs knee-jerk responses</dt>
<dd>By default, people can
spend more time thinking and drafting their messages and
responses. Communication becomes more thoughtful and in-depth. As a bonus,
there are built-in cool-down periods between every message.</dd>
<dt>Less stress thanks to better planning</dt>
<dd>When people can&rsquo;t rely on instant
communication (requests) anymore, they learn to plan ahead more carefully.</dd>
<dt>Deep work becomes the default</dt>
<dd>Because there is no expectation of being
connected and always available, people start their day with a block of deep
work. Again because of the change in expectation, workers can check async
messages a few time a day, when it suits them, and especially when it doesn&rsquo;t
interrupt a block of deep work!</dd>
<dt>Automatic documentation and greater transparency</dt>
<dd>As mentioned in the
previous section, because good asynchronous communication happens through
thoughtful writing and written discussion, all decisions are automatically
documented. Furthermore, it is straight-forward to make discussions available
to any group of people, now and in the future.</dd>
<dt>Time zone equality</dt>
<dd>For organizations that are spread out over multiple
timezones, asynchronous communication means that everyone participates on the
same platform with the same opportunities.</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="the-solution-real-time-sometimes-asynchronous-most-of-the-time">The solution: Real-time sometimes, asynchronous most of the time</h2>
<p>Sometimes synchronous communication is justified.</p>
<p><a href="https://buffer.com/resources/asynchronous-communication/amp/">Buffer</a> lists the following reasons for synchronous, real-time communication,
such as a video meeting or a distanced face-to-face meeting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Casual hangouts, catch-ups, and celebrations</li>
<li>Urgent situations</li>
<li>Relationship-building (one-on-ones, masterminds, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>In their <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/asynchronous/">extensive asynchronous communication guide, Gitlab</a> has a longer list
of occasions that merit starting with synchronous communication:</p>
<ul>
<li>A sales engagement</li>
<li>First-time meetings with external parties</li>
<li>First-time meetings with team members who have not previously worked together</li>
<li>One-way door decisions (e.g. when stakes are high and decisions are difficult to reverse)</li>
<li>Complex initializations (e.g. defining a corporate narrative, a major overhaul to scope, etc.)</li>
<li>Emotionally sensitive topics (e.g. discussing personal issues, career path/promotion, difficult feedback, etc.)</li>
<li>Supporting and unblocking your direct reports (e.g. a regular 1:1)</li>
<li>Celebrations and retrospectives (it feels good to celebrate wins with a
group, and lightweight retrospectives can serve as kickoff points for future
sprints)</li>
</ul>
<p>If asynchronous is to be preferred, but we do sometimes need to use
synchronous, what would be the best way to approach this?</p>
<p>Fortunately, <a href="https://basecamp.com/guides/group-chat-problems#whattodo">Basecamp has a great perfect-world rule of thumb</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>real-time sometimes, asynchronous most of the time</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, prefer and default to asynchronous.</p>
<p>If you opt for synchronous communication such as a meeting or a phone call, you
should have a really good reason to do so.</p>
<p>By making asynchronous the default, with synchronous the exception, your
organization will be able to reap all of the benefits listed in previous
sections.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-just-do-it">Conclusion: Just do it</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear that applying the <em>real-time sometimes, asynchronous most of the
time</em> communication strategy can contribute greatly to an organization&rsquo;s
performance.</p>
<p>More thoughtful communication, better decision-making, more focused work,
automatic documentation and increased work satisfaction constitute an offer
that really should not be refused.</p>
<p>Applying this in your organization starts with ensuring that:</p>
<ol>
<li>everyone understands and applies the asynchronous mindset (see <a href="#gitlab-async-mindset-test">gitlab&rsquo;s
async mindset test</a> for an example),</li>
<li>your async practices and expectations are documented, and</li>
<li>you have the necessary tools available to apply asynchronous communication
effectively.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="further-reading">Further reading</h2>
<p>If you read one other piece, <a href="https://blog.doist.com/asynchronous-communication/"><strong><strong>Doist</strong></strong>&rsquo;s post</a> would be my recommendation. It
contains a complete description of asynchronous communication, with interesting
statistics, and it also contains a short guide on how to apply this in your
organization.</p>
<p>As part of their Virtual First Toolkit, <strong><strong>Dropbox</strong></strong> has also made available their
guide <a href="https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/work-culture/-virtual-first-toolkit--how-to-communicate-effectively">&ldquo;How to communicate effectively&rdquo;</a>. This has practical tips on writing,
tools that can be used for different forms of communication and tips for
effective meeting.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Basecamp</strong></strong> have been making the case for remote work and for asynchronous
communication long before most others.</p>
<p>In their post <a href="https://basecamp.com/guides/group-chat-problems">&ldquo;Group Chat: The Best Way to Totally Stress Out Your Team&rdquo;</a> they
discuss the disadvantages of group chat, and how you can go about addressing
them.</p>
<p>I first wrote about that post of theirs in <a href="/2020/09/20/weekly-head-voices-205-real-time-sometimes-async-most-of-the-time/#the-future-of-work-episode-23">WHV #205</a>.</p>
<p>Their piece <a href="https://basecamp.com/guides/how-we-communicate">&ldquo;The Basecamp Guide to Internal Communication&rdquo;</a> contains 30 general
principles and rules of thumb for communication, followed by a compact and
practical description of the tools and procedures that they apply.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Gitlab</strong></strong> wins the extensiveness competition with their detailed manual titled
<a href="https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/asynchronous/">&ldquo;Embracing asynchronous communication&rdquo;</a>. This contains low-level and detailed
sections on how async is used within the gitlab organization, <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/asynchronous/#how-to-implement-asynchronous-workflows">how to implement
asynchronous workflows</a>, <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/asynchronous/#benefits-of-asynchronous-workflows">benefits of asynchronous</a>, and finally limitations and
challenges of async.</p>
<h3 id="gitlab-async-mindset-test">Gitlab asynchronous mindset test</h3>
<p>Their rule of thumb to enter an asynchronous mindset is worth quoting here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The easiest way to enter into an asynchronous mindset is to ask this question:
&ldquo;How would I deliver this message, present this work, or move this project
forward right now if no one else on my team (or in my company) were awake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This removes the temptation to take shortcuts, or to call a meeting to simply
gather input. (After all, every meeting should be a review of a concrete
proposal, and only called when it will lead to a more efficient outcome than
would be possible asynchronously.)</p>
