<h1 id="nerd-stuff">Nerd stuff</h1>
<p>I fought with VTK renderer window reparenting on three different platforms. Suffice to say that the 2018 is probably also not going to be the year of the Linux desktop.</p>
<p>Serendipitously (seems to be a theme) I came across <a href="https://github.com/lmcinnes/umap">UMAP</a>, a great new technique for dimensionality reduction which functions in the same space (weak math pun, sorry) as <a href="http://lvdmaaten.github.io/tsne/">t-SNE</a>.</p>
<p>My first impressions are great because UMAP is fast, it can be trained, and I really enjoyed this recording of its introduction at SciPy 2018:</p>

<h1 id="outdoorsy-stuff">Outdoorsy stuff</h1>
<p>The highlight of my week was undoubtedly the weekend visit to the <a href="https://www.sanparks.org/parks/west_coast/">West Coast National Park</a> to go greet the brand new flowers of spring.</p>
<p>During my morning run I was greeted by a herd of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_eland">Eland antelope</a>.</p>
<p>Although enormous, they are wary of humans, especially ones running across the savannah in their general direction.</p>
<p>In stark contrast, the ostrich male and female I then ran into were quite vicious, running fairly aggressively to and fro across the the hiking path before me, huffing and puffing. They probably thought that I was a threat to their young.</p>
<p>These birds are not to be trifled with (see for example <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_ostrich#Attacks">this section on wikipedia</a>), but I had to push on, so we played the waiting and shuffling game for a few minutes before I could continue.</p>
<p>At least I knew for sure that I would have the privilege of taking an entirely different route home.</p>
<p>Sometimes one’s arrival on the west coast is perfectly timed, and other times not at all, just like life. This time, the flowers were out in full.</p>
<p>There were brilliant fields of yellow, orange and purple, up and down the mountain-sides.</p>
<p>As if the flowers were not sufficient, we were treated with stunning views of the Grecian-blue sea, and with sunsets like these:</p>

  To use this from Python, you need to add the following to your PATH:
</p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; margin-left: 40px; list-style-type: square; padding: 0px;">
<li style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">
    d:\opt\VTK\bin
  </li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">
  You also need to add <strong>all of the above</strong> to PYTHONPATH, as well as the following:
</p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; margin-left: 40px; list-style-type: square; padding: 0px;">
<li style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">
    d:\opt\VTK\lib\site-packages
  </li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">
  … where d:\opt is the drive and directory where you unpacked the ZIP file.
</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">
  Once you’ve done this and logged out and in again, “import vtk” should work at the Python prompt. Shameless plug: you can use my free <a href="../software/envedit" style="color: #0060ff; text-decoration: underline; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;" title="envedit homepage">envedit</a> software to do the environment editing. It beats the default XP editing thingy.
