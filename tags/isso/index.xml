of the comments on this site to isso, an open-source self-hosted commenting
system.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Comments on this blog are now managed by self-hosted, open-source isso
that I control. Commenting should be much faster and more fun, so have at it!</p>
<h2 id="why-i-recommend-strongly-against-disqus">Why I recommend strongly against Disqus.</h2>
<p>You might recall, or you could just check <a href="/2019/03/31/wordpress-to-hugo/#transfer-comments-to-disqus">the relevant blog
post</a>, that I
ported all comments from wordpress to disqus (grrr&hellip;) in March of this year,
when I upgraded to the Hugo static site generator.</p>
<p>At that point, I had already poured quite some time into the Hugo migration,
and so I thought that trying out Disqus for a while, on a personal site without
any ads whatsoever, couldn&rsquo;t hurt.</p>
<p>I could always at a later stage simply export my comments from there, right?</p>
<p>Wrong.</p>
<p>I triggered the built-in export-functionality in the Disqus admin interface.</p>
<p>The site then shows a message that it will email you when the export is ready.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s now 24 hours later and that email never came&hellip;</p>
<p>(I retried at least 3 times. I even <a href="https://twitter.com/cvoxel/status/1193181451002482690">tweeted at
them</a>, because there&rsquo;s
no other way to contact support.)</p>
<p>When you read the fineprint on <a href="https://help.disqus.com/en/articles/1717199-importing-exporting#exporting-from-disqus">the relevant help
page</a>,
you see the following (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please note: exports <strong>may not be available for all sites</strong>, particularly
those of a large size. If you&rsquo;ve requested an export file more than twice and
still have not received a download link from us, it&rsquo;s likely that an export
for your site is <strong>currently unavailable</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So that&rsquo;s pretty reassuring! You <em>might</em> get an export. It depends&hellip; Whatever
the case may be, you <em>won&rsquo;t</em> get any sort of feedback however.</p>
<p>I guess this is an issue with any hosted solution.</p>
<p>However, one would expect from any such service that advertises the possibility
to export one&rsquo;s <em>own data</em>, even on the free tier, that one is in fact
<em>allowed</em> to export one&rsquo;s own data.</p>
<p>NOT IN DISQUS WORLD!</p>
<p>Anyways, I was not going to let this highly disappointing performance stop my
migration efforts.</p>
<h2 id="enter-isso">Enter isso!</h2>
<p>After discovering that the open-source self-hosted <a href="https://gitlab.com/commento/commento">commento
software</a> requires at least Postgres 9.5
but webfaction (my webhoster for years and years now, unfortunately our ways
will probably have to part thanks to the godaddy acquisition) is stuck at
Postgres 9.4, I decided to configure isso, the same <a href="https://vxlabs.com/2019/04/06/isso-on-webfaction/">commenting system I have
running on vxlabs</a>.</p>
<h3 id="new-feature-auto-approve-previously-approved-authors">New feature: Auto-approve previously approved authors.</h3>
<p>However, to make it a little more interesting, I decided to implement an
auto-moderation feature in isso that I used to use in all my wordpress
installations:</p>
<p><em>Auto-approve authors who have had comments approved in the past N months</em>.</p>
<p>Long story short, you can find my work in <a href="https://github.com/cpbotha/isso/commits/cpbotha-auto-moderate-known-authors">this github fork of
isso</a>.</p>
<p>I will soon create a PR into the main repo. It might or might not get accepted.</p>
<p>Simply edit the <code>moderation</code> section of your <code>isso.cfg</code> to look something like
the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#586e75;background-color:#eee8d5;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ini" data-lang="ini"><span style="color:#859900">[moderation]</span>
<span style="color:#268bd2">enabled</span> = <span style="color:#2aa198">true</span>
<span style="color:#268bd2">activate-if-email-previously-approved</span> = <span style="color:#2aa198">true</span>
</code></pre></div><p>When someone leaves a comment, and their email address has had a comment
approved within the last 6 months, the new comment will be automatically
activated.</p>
<p>The advantage of this feature is that comment-conversations can happen much
more fluidly, without me having to approve each and every comment that comes
in.</p>
<h3 id="migrating-comments-in-spite-of-disqus">Migrating comments in spite of Disqus.</h3>
<p>In NormalWorld, I would have exported an XML from Disqus, and just imported
that into isso using the built-in functionality.</p>
<p>However, in DisqusWorld, the user has to suffer.</p>
<p>Fortunately I could import the bulk of the old comments (up to March of this
year) using the old Wordpress site export and isso&rsquo;s great import function.</p>
<p>For the remaining 25 comments, I manually copied each and every one of them,
along with author name, email (if I knew it) and exact date, and then inserted
them manually into the isso sqlite database, using the amazing
<a href="https://sqlitebrowser.org/">sqlitebrowser</a>.</p>
<p>I discovered three possibly useful facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the <code>parent</code> column in a <code>comment</code> record is not set explicitly to <code>NULL</code>
in the case of no parent, the comment does not show up.</li>
<li>Isso supports only one level of nesting in the database. This means the
<code>parent</code> column has to point to a root, i.e. parent-less, comment.</li>
<li>Isso stores timestamps as seconds since epoch. You can use the following SQL
to convert a timestring to seconds since epoch:</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#586e75;background-color:#eee8d5;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql"><span style="color:#859900">select</span> <span style="color:#268bd2">strftime</span>(<span style="color:#2aa198">&#34;%s&#34;</span>, <span style="color:#2aa198">&#34;2019-08-22 14:11&#34;</span>);
</code></pre></div><p>I was up until 01:00 getting all of this running smoothly.</p>
<p>That is how much I love this blog and its people. :D</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions.</h2>
<p>I am happy that all of your comments are now self-hosted on this server using
open-source software that I have a good grasp of.</p>
<p>I am happy that your valuable thoughts are backed up each and every night.</p>
<p>You should also notice that pages load much faster (disqus is quite slow).</p>
<p>(Also: MARKDOWN!)</p>
<p>Ok folks, I hope this further diminishes any barriers that there might have
been to you leaving us a message now and then!</p>

<p>In this edition of the WHV, I cast my now older eyes back on the week starting
on Monday, April 1 and ending on Sunday, April 7, 2019.</p>
<p>I have to apologise for the extremely high nerd content. There will be wine at
the end to make up for it!</p>
<h2 id="working-late-like-its-1998">Working late like it&rsquo;s 1998.</h2>
<p>At the start of the week, I had resolved to get more sleep.</p>
<p>It seems that when I have a good night&rsquo;s sleep, really working that
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glymphatic_system">glymphatic system</a> (I&rsquo;m
currently fascinated by the glymphatic system, I hope you like it too),
amongst other nightly repair activities, there is a greater probability that I
am able to hold my focus the next day.</p>
<p>This was going swimmingly.</p>
<p>At least that was the case until Wednesday, when I decided that the time had
come to port <a href="https://vxlabs.com/">vxlabs</a>, the far more nerdy sister of this
blog, from <a href="https://cpbotha.net/2019/03/31/wordpress-to-hugo/">wordpress to hugo as
well</a>.</p>
<p>One thing led to another, and by 1:00AM (on a school night no less!) I was
busy wrapping up the isso commenting system configuration.</p>
<p>(We&rsquo;re able to use free and ad-free disqus over here because this is a
personal blog. vxlabs on the other hand is strictly speaking a commercial
site, even although it&rsquo;s filled with non-commercial blog posts.)</p>
<p>One of the many funny things about being a nerd, is that it&rsquo;s almost
impossible to go to bed before a technical thing like this has been
convincingly put to bed.</p>
<p>Fortunately this late night indiscretion yielded a working self-hosted
commenting system, and, far more importantly, a <a href="/2019/04/06/isso-on-webfaction/">rather attractively styled
post, thanks to the Hugo-port, detailing the whole
installation</a>.</p>
<p>In entirely predictable fashion, the next day was not the best focus-wise.</p>
<p>P.S. 1998 - first postgrad year in the DSP lab. All-nighters all the way down&hellip;</p>

<h2 id="nim-surprise">nim-surprise.</h2>
<p>I chose Isso because it&rsquo;s Python.</p>
<p>DayJob(tm) is all about Python, so this was a great choice in terms of time
savings.</p>
<p>With all of the time I had saved, I decided that I would experiment with
re-implementing parts of Isso in <a href="https://fsharp.org/">f#</a>, my current hobby
functional language.</p>
<p>Setting aside the irony here, I learned after some time that getting f#, the
impressive looking <a href="https://fsprojects.github.io/SQLProvider/">SQLProvider</a> and
sqlite (isso&rsquo;s database) all working together on Linux was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fsharp/comments/8ufvzz/how_can_i_add_sqlprovider_to_my_existing_project/e1idy1o/">&ldquo;probably the
single most complicated thing that you can do with a F# project, when it comes
to
tooling&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>In this case, I was thankfully able to switch gears and did a brief review of
possible candidates for a functional(ish), memory efficient, fast(ish)
compilation languages that could be used to implement an Isso web-service
replacement.</p>
<p>Somehow I ended up with <a href="https://nim-lang.org/">nim</a>.</p>
<p>This has been on my radar for a while now, but there were always shinier
things to try.</p>
<p>I think what might have put me off was the similarity to Python.</p>
<p>So, with the rest of the time I had saved choosing Isso, I got up to
speed(ish) with nim by starting to implement a replacement for parts of the
isso commenting system.</p>
<p>I was quite positively surprised by the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compilation speed: The nim compiler transforms my webservice code into C and
then compiles that in about 1.2 seconds.</li>
<li>Performance and memory size of resultant binary: This is not a fair
comparison to Python, but the multi-threaded nim service consumes a few
megabytes in total.</li>
<li>Availability of packages especially for building a web service like this:
Using the nimble package manager, I could install
<a href="https://github.com/dom96/jester">jester</a> and had my first running
web-service in a few minutes.</li>
<li>Built-in sqlite support.</li>
<li>Real macros: I used the list comprehension one in the <code>sugar</code> module.</li>
</ul>
<p>This was really just an exercise (for now), but I have a new tool for whenever
I need to write a fast and compact compiled web-service again!</p>
<p>P.S. Learning new programming languages is one of my favourite things.</p>
<p>P.P.S. Thanks to the internet and open source, and especially tools like
github, we are currently going through a sort of programming language Cambrian
explosion. See this <a href="http://fll.presidentbeef.com/">Fledgling Languages List</a>
for example. Pony!</p>
<h2 id="decompression">Decompression.</h2>
<p>On Sunday, we made the drive out to Jonkershoek in Stellenbosch.</p>
<p>Even although it&rsquo;s only 40 minutes away, I haven&rsquo;t been there in far too
long. It&rsquo;s a truly beautiful corner of the planet.</p>
<p>At the Postcard CafÃ©, after some internal deliberation, I made the decision
that the moment was special enough to interrupt LAZ
(lifestyle-alcohol-zero(tm)) with an all the more special glass of the
<a href="https://winemag.co.za/stark-conde-the-field-blend-2014/">Stark-CondÃ© Field Blend white
wine</a>.</p>
<p>This is a hyper-local blend of Chenin Blanc, Rousanne, Verdelho and Viognier,
all four varietals which grow on the mountain-side right across from the
CafÃ©&rsquo;s veranda.</p>
<p>It really was divine.</p>
