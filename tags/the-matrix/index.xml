<p>As far as I can see now, the week from Monday April 8 to Sunday April 14 2019,
although otherwise quite solid in terms of productivity and of The Important

<p>About the exact implications of this discrepancy, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_a_tree_falls_in_a_forest">I am also not entirely

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Last week, <a href="/2019/04/08/weekly-head-voices-168-postcards-from-the-edge/#nim-surprise">I had happily started diving into the nim language and its
ecosystem</a>.</p>
<p>I was quite happy to hear that in addition to the enjoyment it had given me,
the spark had jumped over to at least one other peep (O HAI THERE S!) via
these writings.</p>
<p>However, after getting deeper into <a href="https://github.com/dom96/jester/issues/194">jester&rsquo;s multi-threading
intricacies</a> and discovering that
I could not get run-time confirmation that my requests were being handled by
separate threads, I returned to my initial target language for this experiment of
rewriting, namely f#!</p>
<p>nim is really a great little experiment: It consists of higher level
abstractions that compile down to C, and it&rsquo;s quite amazing to see what this
enables one to do.</p>
<p>However, I require something richer and more functional for my language
learning slot.</p>
<p>As I have written previously, <a href="/2018/07/17/weekly-head-voices-148-data-stylist/#f">f# hits all six of my 2018
PL-requirements</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to the qualities of the language itself, <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-preview-3/">dotnet core 3, currently
at preview
3</a>, is
showing great progress, also in terms of memory efficiency and raw
performance.</p>
<p>I spent some time during the past week to re-re-implement my
nim-re-implementation of parts of isso, again purely for learning purposes.</p>
<p>(As an aside, it&rsquo;s interesting how close such a real-world example enables one
to get to using a tool or language <em>in anger</em>.)</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a fragment from my learning experiment, because if you&rsquo;re like me
you&rsquo;ll want to see what f# looks like:</p>

handles a request with a <code>uri</code> query parameter. First it looks up the comment
thread in the isso database. If it finds a thread, it looks up the comments
and returns the whole list as JSON.</p>
<p>As you can see, there is error handling at every level.</p>
<p>F# code is expressive, but it is also fully typed. In this case it is
executed asynchronously (that&rsquo;s what the <code>task {}</code> and the <code>!</code>s are for), with
the asynchronous tasks distributed over threads.</p>
<p>In other words, we have a compiled functional language with Python-level
expressivity with really strong (and easy!) concurrency support.</p>

<h2 id="someone-is-right-on-the-internet">Someone is right on the internet.</h2>
<p><em>My</em> week might not have been the most blog-worthy, but, my goodness, the
Wonderful World of Science has not been sitting still!</p>
<p>You see, in desperation I went rummaging through the recent additions to
<a href="/2019/03/21/weekly-head-voices-165-get-in-my-pocket/#replacing-pocket-with-just-a-bunch-of-pdfs-jbop">JBOP</a>,
aka my growing collection of Really Interesting PDFs, and I hand-picked a few
tidbits worthy of casually mentioning during the undoubtedly erudite
discussion at your next cocktail party!</p>
<h3 id="each-millilitre-of-vosub2sub-max-reduces-your-risk-of-dying-by-28">Each millilitre of VO<sub>2</sub> max reduces your risk of dying by 2.8%.</h3>
<p>If we&rsquo;ve run (I see what I did there) into each other more than once, <a href="/2018/10/23/weekly-head-voices-156-karma-chameleon/#grab-bag-of-thought-and-or-debate-provoking-pieces">I&rsquo;ve
probably
mentioned</a>
last year&rsquo;s publication of the Cleveland treadmill study where they put 122000
people on a treadmill (the study took 20 years) to show that being unfit on a
treadmill is at least as risky (in terms of you dying) as being a smoker.</p>
<p>Well, last week the result of an even larger Swedish study, with 316137
participants, <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-04/esoc-mmt040819.php">were reported at EuroPrevent
2019</a>.</p>
<p>With each additional millilitre of oxygen per kilogram of body mass per minute
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VO2_max">VO<sub>2</sub> max, a cardiorespiratory fitness
measure</a>), the risk of all-cause
mortality fell by 2.8%, and the risk of cardiovascular events fell by 3.2%.</p>
<p>According to at least <a href="https://www.topendsports.com/testing/norms/vo2max.htm">one
source</a>, the range
between poor and excellent VO<sub>2</sub> max in most age segments for men and
women is 20 millilitres or more.</p>
<p>At 2.8% per millilitre, that certainly makes one think!</p>
<h3 id="hpv-vaccine-linked-to-dramatic-drop-in-cervical-disease">HPV vaccine linked to dramatic drop in cervical disease.</h3>
<p>Almost exactly 10 years ago, I wrote <a href="/2009/05/21/you-must-vaccinate/">a post on this blog titled &ldquo;You must
vaccinate&rdquo;</a> because friends and acquaintances
were asking questions which I found surprising on the one hand and quite
alarming on the other.</p>
<p>At that point I thought that even the slowest among us would have caught up to
the fact that there are an extremely large number of good reasons to
vaccinate, and almost none not to.</p>
<p>It seems that I over-estimated the capabilities and size of the slow group&hellip;</p>
<p>It is now 10 years later, and the anti-vaxxers have managed to <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/29-11-2018-measles-cases-spike-globally-due-to-gaps-in-vaccination-coverage">bring measles
(and some friends) back from
extinction</a>.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there is also much to celebrate on the vaccination front.</p>
<p>Scotland started with their <a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/human-papillomavirus">human
papillomavirus</a>
vaccination programme 10 years ago, administering the vaccine to girls when
they are at around 12 years of age.</p>
<p>Researchers now say that since then the HPV vaccine has <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-47803975">&ldquo;nearly wiped out
cases of cervical pre-cancer in young
women&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s also heartening is that unvaccinated women also showed a reduction in
disease, implying that the immunisation programme is protecting even more
humans from the disease due to the herd effect.</p>
<p>(GOU#1 had her HPV shot at school last year. There were parents who
complained. I don&rsquo;t know if there were any refusers.)</p>
<p>I am still hopeful that one day all of these victories will contribute to the
attrition of the irresponsibly dangerous anti-vaxx movement.</p>
<h3 id="how-the-matrix-built-a-bullet-proof-legacy">How The Matrix Built A Bullet-Proof Legacy.</h3>
<p>Surprise! This one is not from science, but it was such an amazing read that I
have to share.</p>
<p>If, like me, you saw The Matrix more times than you can count, you will also
enjoy this write-up of how the whole project came together:</p>
<p>Extract from the book <em>How 1999 blew up the Big Screen</em> by Brian Raftery: <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-matrix-legacy-book-excerpt/">HOW
THE MATRIX BUILT A BULLET-PROOF
LEGACY</a></p>
<h2 id="you-never-write">You never write.</h2>
<p>At Tuesday&rsquo;s edition of the Helderberg Software Developers and Entrepreneurs
meetup, organised by <a href="https://wogan.blog/">Wogan May</a> (pssst, he has a
personal blog with mostly weekly updates!) and myself, <a href="http://johan.beyers.co.za/">Johan
Beyers</a> talked about the personal resolution of
doing a given amount of (personal) writing every day.</p>
<p>I try to do it once weekly with the WHV, and I mostly manage to make a few
bullet points detailing my exploits every day, but the idea of additionally
writing a few more prose-like paragraphs of thoughts every day really
resonates with me.</p>
<p>Derek Sivers (he was a famous startup-person even before the whole startup
boom, thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/gerwindehaan">Gerwin de Haan</a> for that book
so many years ago!) <a href="https://sivers.org/dj">makes a good case for writing a few diary-like sentences
every evening</a>.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s even more intriguing, is his suggestion to maintain separate &ldquo;Thoughts
On&rdquo; journals for various topics that you think about often. In my case, these
could be for example &ldquo;Thoughts on Programming Languages&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Thoughts on
mindfulness for children&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Thoughts on the WHV rules for a contented
life&rdquo;, and so on.</p>
<p>I think it would be a cunning plan to give both of these additional writing
practices a good go.</p>
<p>Let me know in the comments what you think!</p>

Read it to become rich, yawn at Lisp and Emacs, yearn to run free on the wide open plains and to learn Kung Fu. Not ambitious at all.</em>

<h1 id="social-democracy-ftw">Social Democracy FTW</h1>
<p>It turns out that your chances of becoming rich are the greatest if you had the good fortune to have been born in one of the Nordic social democracies, such as Norway, Sweden or Denmark.</p>
<p>The US trails these countries, at position 13, in terms of per capita individuals with net worth over $30 million.</p>

<p>Being a proponent of social democracy as the most humane form of currently practical human government, and often infuriating conservatives   by pointing out that many crucial aspects of social democracies can be described as socialistic, I really enjoyed the linked TEDx talk by Norwegian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harald_Eia">Harald Eia</a>.</p>
<p>This material will serve me well as the source of future mischief.</p>
<h1 id="paradigms-of-ai-programming-in-common-lisp">Paradigms of AI Programming in Common Lisp</h1>
<p>I am currently working my way through <a href="https://github.com/norvig/paip-lisp">“Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming: Case Studies in Common Lisp”</a>, Peter Norvig’s famous 1992 book an artificial intelligence. Although modern AI has been transformed almost unrecognisably since then (THANKS DEEP LEARNING! <a href="http://norvig.com/Lisp-retro.html">Norvig’s PAIP retrospective</a>) the way in which Norvig uses Lisp to model and solve real-world problems is inspiring and quite foundational.</p>
<p>It’s not only that though.</p>
<p>My inconvenient but uncontrollable infatuation with Common Lisp also seems to be pulling the strings. I should study a real language which is not 60 years old, like Rust or something.</p>
<p>What attracts me about Common Lisp is the liberated and pragmatic way in which it enables one to mix functional, object-oriented and procedural programming, and, perhaps most importantly, how it was designed from the ground up for iterative and interactive programming.</p>
<p>Tweak the defun, eval the defun, watch the system adapt. This is what I always imagined programming would be like. Except for the Lisps, it really turned out perhaps a bit more boring than it really needs to be.</p>
<h2 id="interleave-mode-for-working-through-pdf-books">interleave-mode for working through PDF books</h2>
<p>For the fellow Emacs users, I also wanted to mention the utility of <a href="https://github.com/rudolfochrist/interleave">interleave-mode</a> for working through such a programming book, if you can find it in PDF format.</p>
<p>In my Emacs I have the PDF on the left, and my interleave-mode-linked orgfile on the right. On any page of the PDF I hit the i-button to add a note in the orgfile, where I can of course insert and execute live code snippets.</p>
<p>The sections in the orgfile remain linked to the correct pages of the PDF.</p>
<p>For programming books this is an amazing combination. For studying other books, having your orgfile notes linked will probably also be quite useful.</p>
<p>On the topic of note-taking: This past week, on Friday June 15 (I made a note of that), I was able to help a colleague solve a technical problem by searching for and retrieving an org-file note, including detailed configuration settings, that I made on May 13, 2014.</p>
<h1 id="ether-as-currency">Ether as currency</h1>
<p>Although I acquired a small amount of the Ether cryptocurrency for the first time in July of 2016, I’ve never had the opportunity to actually transact with it.</p>
<p>Up to now, it has functioned solely as a pretty volatile store of value.</p>
<p>On Saturday, I used some ether for the first time to straight-up buy something on the internet, which was a pretty exciting but in practice an uneventful procedure, fortunately.</p>
<p>The vendor used a payment processor which presented me with an address and corresponding QR code. I scanned the QR code with the relevant mobile app (Luno in this case), paid the requested amount, and waited for a few minutes for it to be multiply confirmed by the blockchain. The sending fee was about 0.04% of the transaction.</p>
<h1 id="barefoot-style-running-update">Barefoot-style running update</h1>
<p>On Sunday I went for a long(ish) run, bringing my total on the Luna sandals to just over 200km.</p>
<p>My feet, ankles and calves are much stronger than they used to be, but the barefoot conversion is clearly still has some ways to go. I have to take at the very least two rest days (instead of one) between runs to give my feet some extra time to recover.</p>
<p>What I have recently started doing, is that instead of trying to micro-manage my form (put your foot down like this, bend your ankle like that, let your achilles tendon shoot back like this, and so on), I am following the advice of some <em>new</em> random person on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BarefootRunning/">reddit/r/BarefootRunning</a> who gave the advice, often echoed elsewhere by barefoot-runners, to try and maintain a cadence (steps-per-minute) of at least 180.</p>
<p>That sounds pretty high for a normal person like me, but it turns out that when I do that, and I try at the same time to run as silently as possible (I often just APPEAR right beside someone, hehe), my legs and feet figure out their elastic bio-kinematics all by themselves.</p>
<p>As yet another random reddit expert (I wish I could find the post) quipped:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can’t overthink proprioception.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(that’s a running nerd joke)</p>
<h1 id="i-know-kung-fu">I know Kung Fu</h1>
<p>Do you remember this scene from The Matrix (1999)?</p>

<p>The other day at the <a href="/2018/06/03/weekly-head-voices-144-eternal-learner/#reunion">Old People Reunion</a>, friend T. Monster, a highly capable pragmatist but also backyard theoretician, talked about how often it happened these days that you had to deal with some DIY issue, tapped or spoke the question into youtube, watched a video or two, and then fixed the issue like a pro.</p>
<p>This, along with my recent pseudo-expert repair of a number of stripped cabinet hinge screw holes with tooth picks and cold glue (this works, I kid you not), made me think that, although The Matrix version was perhaps far more spectacular, we in fact now find ourselves in a <em>real, shared reality</em> where a large subset of skills can be acquired <em>a la carte</em>.</p>
<p>Some may take longer than a few minutes, but it still is pretty amazing how far YouTube has managed to democratise so many different forms of modern Kung Fu.</p>
