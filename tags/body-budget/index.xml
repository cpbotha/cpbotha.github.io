<h2 id="merry-christmas">Merry Christmas</h2>
<p>During this week, the most noteworthy happening was of course Christmas.</p>
<p>As a family, we are wholly dedicated to the pursuit and application of Love and
Science. However, we do try to respect the religious customs of our fellow
humans.</p>
<p>In the light of this, respectfully and retrospectively, I wish you all a very
merry christmas!</p>
<p>(I have to say that my kids really adore the gifting-aspect of this
particular celebration, if you get my drift.)</p>
<h2 id="creativity-inc-dot-book-notes-published">Creativity, Inc. book notes published</h2>
<p>I finally got around to processing and publishing <a href="/2020/12/22/book-notes-creativity-inc/">my notes on the book
<em>Creativity, Inc.</em> by Ed Catmull</a>.</p>
<p>There are a number of great nuggets in there if you are at all interested to
learn about the care and feeding of sustainable creative organizations.</p>
<p>Even if that&rsquo;s not your cup of tea, being able to take a look inside a company
like Pixar is quite fascinating.</p>
<p>BTW, books are really cheap upgrades for your brain&rsquo;s operating system.</p>
<p>BTW, I&rsquo;m planning more book notes.</p>
<h2 id="body-budgets">Body Budgets</h2>
<p>On that topic, I have just started reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48930266-seven-and-a-half-lessons-about-the-brain">Seven and a Half Lessons About the
Brain</a> by psychologist and neuro-scientist Lisa Feldman Barrett, after listening
to another <a href="https://lexfridman.com/lisa-feldman-barrett/">super-entertaining podcast with her and Lex Fridman</a>.</p>
<p>I am planning to write much more about her ideas, but for now I would like to
plant this memetic seed:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/23/opinion/brain-neuroscience-stress.html">Our big brains evolved to manage our body budgets</a>.</p>
<p>In short, managing the metabolic needs of a whole human is tremendously
complicated.</p>
<p>Throughout the day (every day), that big super-computer in your head is
calculating a million inputs and outputs to ensure your survival, and more
importantly, the survival of your genetic material.</p>
<p>To me, a truly interesting aspect of this is that social interaction is just
another, albeit important, variable in this complicated system of equations.</p>
<p>One of the implications of this realization is that social interaction requires
a substantial amount of metabolic energy, an equation your brain will apply
quite strictly.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re getting low on energy, your brain could very well cancel that kind
interaction you were planning, instead substituting with a quick eject, because
it predicts (the brain is a fabulous prediction machine, you&rsquo;ll see much more
of that here in the coming months) that you&rsquo;ll probably run out of energy a bit
later.</p>
<p>Related to what <a href="/2020/12/23/weekly-head-voices-212-use-it-or-lose-it/#use-it-or-lose-it">I wrote last week concerning the use-it-or-lose-it principle</a>,
this is yet another reason to invest in one&rsquo;s physiology and its energy
efficiency:</p>
<p><em>Your body needs energy to be nice.</em></p>
