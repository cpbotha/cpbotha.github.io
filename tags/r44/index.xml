<p>(The level and amount of human excitement on the sides of the road was also something to experience.)</p>

During the past week, there were at least three or four occasions where someone was clearly wrong on the internet, and I dutifully started carefully crafting that brilliant corrective response which would inevitably spiral downward into the fiery depths of idiocy.
However, each time I stopped mid-answer, long before clicking the post button or sending the email, and switched to some other more valuable and less pointless activity.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <div class="figure">

<p>I must be getting older.</p>
<p>During the past week, there were at least three or four occasions where someone was clearly <em>wrong</em> on the internet, and I dutifully started carefully crafting that <em>brilliant</em> corrective response which would inevitably spiral downward into the fiery depths of idiocy.</p>
<p>However, each time I stopped mid-answer, long before clicking the post button or sending the email, and switched to some other more valuable and less pointless activity. It was a strange feeling, but the eerie sense of having saved a bunch of time made up for it generously.</p>
<p>(I have to admit that there was one occasion, call it the fifth, where I couldn’t help myself and briefly took part in a Facebook discussion around a photo of a young man with some rather extreme facial piercings. I felt that I really needed to <em>correct</em> the other participants: I might not have any of my own body modifications, but I feel strongly about encouraging self-expression, and I think that the variety that it brings is important. There are <em>other</em> things that unify us, like love, respect and intellect. Yes, I’m a Vulcan Hippie. LLAP you fools!)</p>
<p>On the topic of age and the inevitable mid-life crisis, it seems technology has brought us the cure. GIANT WATER-JET-POWERED HOVERBOARDS!!</p>

<p>After a week of not-correcting-the-internet (good), lots of Python (good) and much face-palming at the South African Reserve Bank’s archaic view on intellectual property and exchange control (hopefully much more on that later), my weekend was of the fabulous middle-of-the-Cape-winter variety.</p>
<p>It started with some of this on Friday: <figure class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 300px"><a data-rel="lightbox-image-0" data-rl_caption="" data-rl_title="" href="http://cpbotha.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wpid-jack_black_skeleton_coast_ipa.jpg" title=""></p>

<p>On Saturday, a completely unplanned and somewhat impulsive turnoff from the R44 right before Stellenbosch brought us to the <a href="http://www.dornier.co.za/">vineyard Dornier</a>. Some of it looks like this: <figure class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 300px"><a data-rel="lightbox-image-1" data-rl_caption="" data-rl_title="" href="http://cpbotha.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wpid-dornier_20140629.jpg" title=""></p>

<p>Having <em>arrived</em> there, it doesn’t take much convincing to end up dining in restaurant Bodega, where the wine is <strong>very</strong> local (hey, it says Dornier on the bottles!) and is artfully paired with the delicious food. My lunch ended with these delectable cheeses, preserves and the <a href="http://www.dornier.co.za/wines/donatus-white">Dornier Donatus White</a>. I can’t remember the year, but it was a fabulous Chenin Blanc and Semillon blend which <a href="http://dewijnrecensent.nl/">the DWR</a> will hopefully soon be able to judge. I fortunately <em>just</em> managed to snap this picture in the midst of a gorgonzola-induced mini pleasure seizure: <figure class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 300px"><a data-rel="lightbox-image-2" data-rl_caption="" data-rl_title="" href="http://cpbotha.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wpid-dornier_20140629_cheese.jpg" title=""></p>

<p>(We spent the rest of the seemingly endless weekend scorching various types of meat, drinking craft beer and baking in the winter sun in Paarl. You can say many things about Paarl, but you can’t deny that it has a most <em>excellent</em> climate.)</p>
<p>Apparently, a few of this blog’s readers have been wondering what I really look like. (Well, actually no-one has. Ever. But they could have!) Clamour no more, small group of fictitious readers! This week, my youngest genetic offspring unit, or GOU#1 as we lovingly call her, brought me a drawing that she made. Internet, I give you <em>me</em>, through my daughter’s eyes:</p>

<p>You know the rules: We write short summaries of our week’s activities, often in the form of bullet lists. I’m going to break both rules this time by rambling on about the past three weeks, and by showing you a bunch of photos I took on the weekends.</p>
<p>I’d like to show you how the autumn weekends here in SA can be quite harsh, but first I need to geek out for a bit (do not fear non-nerds, there are pictures after this brief interlude!):</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m back with Emacs. &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 On my continuous search for the ultimate information organizing system I have now arrived editing the Markdown files contained in a git-backed <a href="https://github.com/gollum/gollum" title="Gollum github page">Gollum wiki</a> with my Emacs 24.3. I even wrote a (nerdy) <a href="http://vxlabs.com/2014/04/08/syntax-highlighting-markdown-fenced-code-blocks-in-emacs/" title="vxlabs blog post on emacs fenced code block highlighting">blog post explaining how you to can configure your Emacs to do language-specific fenced code-block syntax highlighting</a>. Somehow Emacs and I are just getting along much better than we did before my Vim period (dark dark days). I think it’s because I’ve decided to embrace the Lisp, which brings me to:</li>
<li>In my copious amounts of free time, I was searching for a functional language to learn. The <a href="http://www.erlang.org/doc/getting_started/users_guide.html" title="Erlang tutorial">Erlang tutorial</a> was enjoyable, but I was not too crazy about what I read about the details of deploying Erlang systems. I bought <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/" title="Learn you a Haskell, man!">Learn you a Haskell for Great Good</a> and started reading it, but somehow Haskell didn’t tickle me enough. Then, probably infected by having to look at Emacs Lisp again, I picked up the <a href="http://www.clojurebook.com/" title="Clojure Programming">Clojure Programming book</a>. Now that pushed all of the right buttons! I haven’t this much fun with a new language since I picked up Python, and my mind has been expanded at a few points as well (what do you mean the code that I write <strong>IS</strong> the AST?! (Picture my Neo face saying: “Whoa.”)). <a href="http://clojure.org/" title="clojure website">Clojure</a> is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">Lisp</a> dialect that does a pretty good job of walking the line between beauty and pragmatism. Built on the JVM (and having full interop with the rest of Java) it also has STM (software transactional memory), agents, and async channels all built-in. As if that wasn’t enough, I get to use Emacs with the CIDER package to play with it. (<code>M-x cider-jack-in</code> starts up the Clojure REPL and then… JACKS ME IN.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Err, I might have exhausted my nerd quota for the week. Let’s do the rest of the Weekly Head Voices in pictures!</p>
<p>Three weekends ago I went to visit the Spice Route farm in the Paarl with family and friends. Besides the coffee roastery, the chocolatier, the winery and the two restaurants, this farm also houses the Cape Brewing Company, a magical place that produces delicious craft beers, which you can taste, and take home with you. The view is not too shabby either:

<p>On the topic of delicious craft beers, THIS, my dear readers, is The Darling Bone Crusher, another super tasty white beer constructed with much love in the town called Darling:

<p>… and this is the sun setting on some Milk and Honey, crafted in Knysna (this one is quite good, but their other ale called the Old Wobbly is even nicer):

<p>Lest you think all we do is drink craft beers around here, here’s a photo of the vicious river delta I had to cross during my afternoon fitness activity (this was before we started drinking craft beers again):

<p>On the way back home after another harsh weekend, we were stuck in some sort of traffic jam. After a few minutes inching ahead, we ran into the culprits causing our delay:








<figure><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/baboons_on_cars.jpg">
    <img

</p>
<p>(Yes, those are baboons sitting on people’s cars. “Oh, were you planning to drive that sir? You’re going to have to wait until the baboon decides it’s time to go home.”)</p>
<p>The road we were on (the R44 between Gordon’s Bay and Betty’s Bay) is one of the prettiest I know. On another of these autumn weekends, it looked like this:
