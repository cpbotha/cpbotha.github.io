I do this in spite of having a beefy NVIDIA GPU in this Core i7 workstation, because the OpenGL compositing on this 2560×1440 display makes video conferencing really slow, and because I do OpenGL development and need to have maximum performance for the app I’m working on.
However, it irritated me to no end that the window borders were so thin that I was not able to grab them for a resize. Adding insult to injury, there were only the four standard themes in Settings | Appearance, namely Adwaita, Ambiance, Radiance and High Contrast, none of which has usable borders.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>On Ubuntu I mostly use <a href="http://www.webupd8.org/2014/04/how-to-install-and-tweak-gnome.html">Gnome Flashback with Metacity</a>, along with the brilliant <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5704221/synapse-is-a-super-fast-tightly-integrated-application-launcher-for-linux">Synapse app starter / file finder</a>. I do this in spite of having a beefy NVIDIA GPU in this Core i7 workstation, because the OpenGL compositing on this 2560×1440 display makes video conferencing really slow, and because I do OpenGL development and need to have maximum performance for the app I’m working on.</p>
<p>However, it irritated me to no end that the window borders were so thin that I was not able to grab them for a resize. Adding insult to injury, there were only the four standard themes in Settings | Appearance, namely Adwaita, Ambiance, Radiance and High Contrast, none of which has usable borders.</p>
<p>The solution is to use the Gnome Tweak Tool (package gnome-tweak-tool) to change the Window theme to something with better borders. I used <em>Watercolor</em> (from the metacity-themes package), and set the rest up as follows on the appearance tab:</p>
<img alt="tweak-tool-theme" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2342" data-attachment-id="2342" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title="tweak-tool-theme" data-large-file="https://cpbotha.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/tweak-tool-theme.png" data-medium-file="https://cpbotha.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/tweak-tool-theme-300x116.png" data-orig-file="https://cpbotha.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/tweak-tool-theme.png" data-orig-size="732,283" data-permalink="https://cpbotha.net/2016/01/22/fix-the-unusable-window-resize-border-in-gnome-flashback-metacity-on-ubuntu/tweak-tool-theme/" height="283" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" src="https://cpbotha.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/tweak-tool-theme.png" srcset="https://cpbotha.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/tweak-tool-theme.png 732w, https://cpbotha.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/tweak-tool-theme-300x116.png 300w" width="732"/>
<p>Once this is done, your window borders should look like this:</p>
<img alt="watercolor-window-borders" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2344" data-attachment-id="2344" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title="watercolor-window-borders" data-large-file="https://cpbotha.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/watercolor-window-borders.png" data-medium-file="https://cpbotha.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/watercolor-window-borders-300x205.png" data-orig-file="https://cpbotha.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/watercolor-window-borders.png" data-orig-size="400,273" data-permalink="https://cpbotha.net/2016/01/22/fix-the-unusable-window-resize-border-in-gnome-flashback-metacity-on-ubuntu/watercolor-window-borders/" height="273" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 85vw, 400px" src="https://cpbotha.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/watercolor-window-borders.png" srcset="https://cpbotha.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/watercolor-window-borders.png 400w, https://cpbotha.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/watercolor-window-borders-300x205.png 300w" width="400"/>
<p>Now you can resize your windows again, AND you can enjoy the snappiness of Gnome Flashback with Metacity!</p>

<strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: you might have to install the MS VS2008 SP1 <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=A5C84275-3B97-4AB7-A40D-3802B2AF5FC2&amp;displaylang=en" title="Link to MS VS2008 SP redistributable">vcredist_x86</a> package (free!) if you want to use these DLLs (thanks Jelle for pointing this out).  This might not be necessary if you already have one or more of the MS development environments installed.

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">
  To use this from Python, you need to add the following to your PATH:
</p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; margin-left: 40px; list-style-type: square; padding: 0px;">
<li style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">
    d:\opt\VTK\bin
  </li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">
  You also need to add <strong>all of the above</strong> to PYTHONPATH, as well as the following:
</p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; margin-left: 40px; list-style-type: square; padding: 0px;">
<li style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">
    d:\opt\VTK\lib\site-packages
  </li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">
  … where d:\opt is the drive and directory where you unpacked the ZIP file.
</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">
  Once you’ve done this and logged out and in again, “import vtk” should work at the Python prompt. Shameless plug: you can use my free <a href="../software/envedit" style="color: #0060ff; text-decoration: underline; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;" title="envedit homepage">envedit</a> software to do the environment editing.

<p>It’s almost <em>that time</em> again, so I have begun shopping around (in WAB time, of course) for an affordable yet absurdly fast desktop for use at home, in my secret laboratory.  Oh wait, there’s no secret laboratory.  Really.</p>
<p>I was planning to get something with the <a href="http://tweakers.net/pricewatch/150358/intel-core-2-quad-q6600.html" title="Tweakers price-watch for Q6600">Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600</a> (4 cores at 2.4 GHz, 2 x MB L2 cache, 1066 MHz quad-clocked FSB), but <a href="http://graphics.tudelft.nl/~jorik/" title="Jorik's website (kinda)">Jorik</a> fortunately recommended (thanks!) waiting for the soon-to-be-available Penryn 45nm quad cores.   Seems <a href="http://core.tweakers.net/nieuws/51163/intel-presenteert-zestien-nieuwe-processors-met-45nm-techniek.html" title="Intel announces 16 new 45nm CPUs">Intel has announced</a> the definite release of 16 new 45nm CPUs at the CES, including the similarly price-ranged but far more desirable <a href="http://tweakers.net/pricewatch/161727/intel-core-2-quad-q9450.html" title="Tweakers price-watch for Q9450">Quad Q9450</a> (4 cores at 2.66 GHz, 2 x 6MB L2 cache, 1333 MHz quad-clocked FSB).</p>
<p>Throw 4 GB of DDR2 RAM, a Hitachi P7K500 half terabyte hard drive, a passively cooled GeForce 8600 GT 512MB and some 64-bit Ubuntu goodness at it, and you have some serious workstation action that doesn’t even leave you half-destitute!</p>
