the WHV Monday looks back on the days from Monday December 9 to Sunday December

<p>There&rsquo;s a buck (a sort of goat), probably of the duiker variety, really showing

<h2 id="we-are-load-shedding-again">We are load shedding again.</h2>
<p>So yeah, there&rsquo;s that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re load shedding again.</p>
<p>Everything I wrote &ldquo;<a href="/2019/03/24/weekly-head-voices-166-morgan-bay/#on-being-powerless">on being
powerless</a>&rdquo;
in March of this year is again happening, down to me spending more time on
Twitter again (DANG IT) searching for voices that might indicate justice
eventually being served.</p>
<p>In spite of the fact that our home is now more or less load-shedding-proof due
to it being for the largest part <a href="/2019/06/30/weekly-head-voices-172-abc/#solar-powerrrrrrrr">solar
powered</a> this time
around, the rotating power outages (we had a week or two of stage 4, i.e. 3 x
2.5 hour outages per day, and one evening of escalation to stage 6) are an
upsetting reminder of the decades-long and now continuing incompetence and
corruption of the country&rsquo;s leadership.</p>
<p>Apart from the numerous mental cycles this phenomenon has been <em>stealing</em> (see
what I did there) from my work focus, it is hard not to notice how businesses,
colleagues and friends are being hit by this.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s perhaps new this time, is that <a href="https://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2019-10-29-eskom-board-member-slams-interference-says-there-should-be-load-shedding/">it has been confirmed by an Eskom board
member</a>
that the same politicians who have caused this mess, are <em>still</em> meddling in
technical affairs they have no idea about, for all of the wrong reasons.</p>
<p>To put it quite bluntly, instead of trying to address the almost insurmountable
technical problems at the electricity supplier, it seems that the ruling party
(the ANC of course) for example insisted that the electricity be kept on at all
costs during the elections.</p>
<p>Numerous incidences of this sort of interference helped them to save face over
the years, at the cost of further debilitating the already fragile South
African economy.</p>
<p>At this moment, as large parts of industry are shutting down for the Christmas
period, we are enjoying a respite from load shedding.</p>
<p>We will see what happens in the new year.</p>
<p>The board member quoted above stated that if meddling had not been such a
concern, and they could face the technical problems head-on, we were looking at
at least 8 months of load shedding.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that the people would be able to deal with it if those cards were
simply laid on the table, without all of the political meddling and backroom
dealings.</p>
<p>As was the case the previous time, I do remain hopeful that the number of
spines in power grows, and that the electricity provider is able to focus all
of its energy on addressing the significant problems that it faces.</p>
<h2 id="time-restricted-eating-tre-with-black-coffee-please">Time-restricted Eating (TRE) with Black Coffee please.</h2>
<p>I think it was Reader K who introduced me to the idea of time-restricted
eating, or TRE, a year or two ago.</p>
<p>(Together we tried to figure out on which medium this happened, because under
normal circumstances I would have wanted to look up the exact time and contents
of the messages.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we discovered that it must have been via Facebook Messenger, and
somewhere between then and now Reader K had expunged their whole Facebook
history.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lesson in here somewhere, but we have to forge ahead, so
we&rsquo;re going to have to side-step it.)</p>
<p>Time-restricted eating, or TRE, is a sort of intermittent fasting where the
eating window is deliberately limited to an as short as possible duration
during the daytime.</p>
<p>The theory behind it is that our metabolism is in fact also ruled by the
all-powerful circadian clock.</p>
<p>During our long evolution, we would have been foraging and feeding during
daylight, and resting during the night.</p>
<p>With artificial light and the ubiquitousness of food of modern times, we easily
fall into the habit of starting to eat when we wake up, and having the last
snack shortly before going to sleep, hours after sunset.</p>
<p>In short, we really do eat too much, and to make it even worse, we eat at all
the wrong times.</p>
<p>With research around TRE, science, as is its wont, is showing us the way back
to redemption.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s starting to look like limiting one&rsquo;s feeding window to a few hours during
daylight could have a number of health advantages.</p>
<p>See for example:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4255155/">Time-restricted feeding is a preventative and therapeutic intervention
against diverse nutritional
challenges</a> - a 2014
Cell Biology study with mice.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/12/191205141731.htm">Clinical study finds eating within 10-hour window may help stave off
diabetes, heart
disease</a> - a 2019 Science Daily summary.</li>
<li><a href="https://m2performancenutrition.com/blog/can-time-restricted-feeding-make-you-fitter">Can time restricted feeding make you
fitter</a> -
a reasonable overview.</li>
</ul>
<p>After a debate with friend LM about whether black sugarless coffee constituted
a break of the TRE fast (I thought that it did due to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6KClPkotxM">this conversation
between Rhonda Patrick and Joe
Rogan</a>, friend LM did not, so I
initially did not even try TRE because I am unable to operate without black
coffee in the mornings), I have been dipping my toes in the TRE pool.</p>
<p>I have never been a breakfast person (&ldquo;Breakfast is the most important meal of
the day&rdquo; ??! TRUST NO ONE.), so sticking to black coffee in the mornings until
as late as possible, which is in many cases lunch, and not eating anything
after dark, has subjectively worked out pretty well so far.</p>
<p>Sometimes, shortly before lunch, there seems to be a slight delusional quality
to my seemingly enhanced mental clarity, but let&rsquo;s keep that between you and
me.</p>
<h2 id="anniversary-walk-up-the-mountain">Anniversary walk up the mountain.</h2>
<p>Recently, my life partner and I celebrated two decades of official
togetherness by walking up the Helderberg mountain.</p>
<p>We did not quite make West Peak, and we were pretty bushed by the end, but
that&rsquo;s ok. The scenery was epic, and getting back home was brilliant.</p>
<p>We will try again in 2029.</p>

<h2 id="blogosphere-housekeeping">Blogosphere housekeeping.</h2>
<p>In my eternal quest to avoid the new Gutenberg editor in WordPress (now at version 5.1.1), this and the previous post were typed up in Orgmode, and then copy-pasted from the Emacs-exported HTML.</p>
<h2 id="on-being-powerless">On being powerless.</h2>
<p>Years of corruption, in most cases made possible by the current ruling party, the ANC, have left our electricity-producing monoply, Eskom, in shambles.</p>
<p>Billions of rands disappeared into the pockets of dishonest types, instead of being invested into the maintenance and upgrades of our power generation and distribution network.</p>
<p>The result of all of this, is that the country currently has to deal with stage 4 load shedding, which means that electricity is completely shut off for 2.5 hours, three times a day.</p>
<p>This has to be done in order to prevent a total grid shutdown, which would result in a two to three week national electricity outage whilst the grid has to be started back up again.</p>
<p>You can read more about the details in <a href="https://www.businessinsider.co.za/6-quick-fixes-that-can-save-south-africa-from-more-load-shedding-2019-3">this Business Insider article</a>.</p>
<p>Anyways, although there are many worse problems than this in the world today, these 7.5 powerless hours every day are a fairly visceral reminder of the utterly disappointing lack of integrity and leadership in our government.</p>
<p>At a more microscopic level, I am again spending far more time than usual on twitter, as this is where news about the electricity crisis plays out first.</p>
<p>Unfortunately Twitter, or <em>Road Rage of the Internet</em> as it has been called, does not contribute positively to one’s karma, which is the exact opposite of what is required here.</p>
<p>On the bright(ish) side, it does seem as if the whole drama is being adequately documented and analysed in the media.</p>
<p>Although there are fundamental issues at Eskom that need to be addressed, such as the fact that a state-owned entity has the monopoly over electricity production, I am optimistic that there are enough capable folks at Eskom, <em>with</em> spines, to band-aid the system back into operation.</p>
<p>I am less optimistic but still hopeful that this will result in deeper rectifications to both our power production strategy and, more acutely, the South African government.</p>

<p>GOU #1 left us for a week-long, zero-communication canoeing trip, along with about 60 of her fellow pupils, down the Orange River.</p>
<p>Although quite a challenge for our parental hearts, we did expect that this would be quite a valuable adventure for a 12 year old.</p>
<p>We were not wrong, but it sounds as if above-mentioned teenager experienced the adventure more like a week-long party with canoeing breaks thrown in for good measure.</p>
<p>While she was away, the rest of us spent the week on the East coast, in a beautiful coastal village called Morgan Bay.</p>
<p>To be more specific, we stayed at the Morgan Bay Hotel, a brilliant little family-run hotel at the core of the village.</p>
<p>The view from our room was not too shabby. In fact, it looked a little bit like this:

<p>Morning runs, on barefoot, often looked like this:

<p>… and sometimes the World’s Worst Trail Runner (me), took on trails, in wet sandals, which were perhaps a tad too technical. See the following beaut for example:

<p>Under immense beer peer pressure, and in the presence of locally brewed craft beer on tap, I finally broke my 2.5 month long alcohol fast with an Emerald Vale Amber Ale.</p>
<p>The beer was tasty, and the moment was suitably bittersweet.

<p>I was happy to find after 10 weeks of zero alcohol that I could drink craft beer like a normal person, without any acclimatisation or noticeable ill effects.</p>
<p>However, thanks to consistently great sleep and subjectively more overall acuity, I will probably continue with zero (or very little) alcohol for a while longer.</p>

<p>I am happy that we ended up with family in Betty’s Bay this weekend.</p>
<p>The recent fires have stripped away so much vegetation that I was easily able to reach a spot I had never been able to navigate to before.</p>
<p>I made a panorama in which you can hopefully appreciate some of the devastation caused by the blaze:
