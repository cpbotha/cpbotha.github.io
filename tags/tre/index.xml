<h2 id="learn-you-a-tiny-bit-of-erlang-for-great-good">Learn you a tiny bit of Erlang for Great Good!</h2>
<p>Last week I attended a meetup that turned out to be primarily about Erlang and
not so much about automated crypto arbitrage, the other topic of the
talk. Although it&rsquo;s interesting to me that we have a company right here in
this town that has been successfully doing automated crypto arbitrage for a few
years now, using Erlang!</p>
<p>Like many other folks, I became interested in Erlang back in 2013 (I just
checked my notes, but it was also <a href="/2014/04/21/weekly-head-voices-68-harsh-autumn-weekends/">mentioned on this blog in 2014</a>, when I
decided not to learn it) when WhatsApp started becoming well-known. The
WhatsApp backend was famously implemented in Erlang, enabling them to handle
hundreds of millions, and now billions, of users with relatively little
resources.</p>
<p>The first two hours of the talk was a detailed intro to Erlang that did require
a substantial amount focus and grit to keep up with.</p>
<p>However, understanding how light-weight Erlang processes work and talk to each
other was quite interesting. More importantly the speaker both really knew what
he was talking about, and spoke really well.</p>
<p>The last 20 minutes or so after that were great, more about how and why exactly
Shiftly uses Erlang to do their real-time crypto arbitrage.</p>
<p>Their Erlang system is self-healing (when one of the light-weight processes
dies, for whatever reason, its supervisor simply replaces it; there are
supervisors watching the other supervisors!), and usually runs for years on
end, keeping all of its state in memory. They usually only have to stop it to
perform security upgrades on the underlying operating system.</p>
<p>Erlang processes pull in feeds from forex and various other suppliers, monitor
order books in real-time, and then execute movements on crypto trading pairs
that are affected by any order book entry.</p>
<p>My main take-home was that Erlang seems to combine super light-weight processes
(you can run millions of them on a single machine) that are fully isolated (a
process can divide by zero, be killed and a new one takes its place) but can
still easily share code and data via messages.</p>
<p>It seems like the antithesis to the sticky and sometimes over-complicated
micro-services situation we have collectively gotten ourselves into.</p>
<p>All of that being said, the same caveats apply as using another actor platform
like akka.net for example: Everything is unicorns and rainbows if you stay
within the lines (i.e. strict Erlang, or pure .NET managed code in akka&rsquo;s
case).</p>
<p>When you start adding native code, things can still go quite badly awry.</p>
<p>Still, the Erlang actor-based approach to writing highly concurrent and
fault-tolerant code sure looks amazing!</p>
<h2 id="i-really-don-t-like-breakfast">I really don&rsquo;t like breakfast</h2>
<p>Some of my friends know that I&rsquo;ve been quite angry at breakfast for a while
now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m referring specifically to the idea that has been quite successfully
propagated by the makers of breakfast cereal for as long as I can remember:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Breakfast is the most important meal of the day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So they really want you to eat their usually sugar-filled products first thing
in the morning, and they&rsquo;ve convinced you, and most of the &ldquo;field&rdquo;, that this
is healthy.</p>
<h3 id="eating-causes-inflammation">Eating causes inflammation</h3>
<p>What many people don&rsquo;t realise, is that every single meal causes inflammation.</p>
<p>Postprandial inflammation, as this is called, is your body&rsquo;s normal response to
any foreign material entering its systems.</p>
<p>Refined foods, and especially sugar, cause much more inflammation per volume
than natural foods, such as fruit and vegetables. Some food types even
counteract the inflammation to a certain extent.</p>
<p>Can you see where this is going?</p>
<p>A few hours after dinner you go to bed, your body still dealing with
the inflammation caused by that dinner.</p>
<p>You <em>hopefully</em> sleep for 8 hours or more, and your body finally gets a break.</p>
<h3 id="the-problem-with-breakfast">The problem with breakfast</h3>
<p>What do you do when you get up? You eat breakfast, because it&rsquo;s entrenched in
your brain (thanks to years of marketing) that breakfast is healthy and should
not be skipped, instead starting up a full day&rsquo;s inflammation again.</p>
<p><a href="https://nutritionandmetabolism.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12986-016-0142-6">This article in Nutrition &amp; Metabolism</a> describes the phenomenon quite nicely:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The typical Western diet is characterized by sizable portions of highly
processed foods, large amounts of added sugars, and a high total fat
content. The average fat content of a Western meal is between 20 and 40 g, and
three to four meals per day are consumed regularly. Therefore, many individuals
spend the majority of their day in a postprandial state, characterized by
elevated levels of circulating triglycerides (TRG) following a meal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chronic low-grade inflammation is associated with metabolic disorders that
include obesity, type 2 diabeters and the metabolic syndrome. Furthermore, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26629551/">low
inflammation predicts successful ageing</a>.</p>
<p>In short, we want as little as possible inflammation, not more.</p>
<p>There are fortunately a few great ways to mitigate feeding&rsquo;s role in
inflammation: 1. Eat the best food you can find, 2. eat less food and,
importantly, 3. try not to eat for the whole dang day.</p>
<p>My anger at breakfast and its cereal-maker proponents is because they have
sabotaged point 3 above, sending a large part of the western populace into
glucose metabolism and inflammation every single morning.</p>
<h3 id="skip-you-some-breakfast-for-great-good">Skip you some breakfast for great good</h3>
<p>This <a href="https://www.dietdoctor.com/intermittent-fasting/time-restricted-eating">blog post on time-restricted eating</a> is definitely worth your time. Here I
would like to reproduce what it has to say about breakfast:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have all been told to eat breakfast. Unfortunately this is inaccurate
advice.</p>
<p>When you first wake up in the morning, your insulin level is quite low and most
people are just starting to enter the fasted state, 12 hours after eating the
last meal of the previous day. Eating at this time raises insulin and glucose
and immediately shuts off fat-burning. This is especially true for a high carb
breakfast. A potentially better choice would be to push the first meal of your
day out at least a few hours, during which time you can continue in the fasted
state and burn stored body fat.</p>
<p>Interestingly, many properly fat-adapted people aren&rsquo;t very hungry in the
morning and have no problem skipping breakfast.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From personal experience I can confirm this: I usually don&rsquo;t get hungry <em>at
all</em> until lunch-time, at the earliest.</p>
<p>(If I&rsquo;m planning to go on a morning run, I will usually eat a few bananas right
before the outing to be able to keep up a higher pace. I have also run fasted,
but in that case my pace is automatically more relaxed.)</p>
<p>In this context, it&rsquo;s interesting to look at <a href="https://peterattiamd.com/my-nutritional-framework/">Peter Attia&rsquo;s nutritional
framework</a> as well. He refers to eating less, eating specific things and
restricting when you eat as three levers that have to be regularly
pulled.</p>
<p>Pulling these levers helps your body to become metabolically flexible, that is,
being able to switch easily between glucose burning and fat burning, the latter
of which many western humans are not capable of anymore.</p>
<p>It is interesting in this regard that our brains, although they can run on fat
when required, strongly prefer glucose (source: fascinating podcast episode
<a href="https://peterattiamd.com/husseinyassine/">&ldquo;Hussein Yassine, M.D.: Deep dive into the &lsquo;Alzheimer’s gene&rsquo; (APOE), brain
health, and omega-3s&rdquo;</a>). I&rsquo;m still working out the implications of this on my
personal intellectual requirements.</p>
<p>Ok friends, thank you for sticking around for this sermon!</p>
<p>Next week: A whole bunch of information that in fact does constitue financial
and investment advice that I take full responsibility for. (haha just
joking. it&rsquo;ll be politics or religion.)</p>

The passing of time usually seems to be quite a theoretical affair, but at this moment I can really feel the year taking its last few breaths.
(People even seem to think of this as the last year of the decade, which makes it all the more dramatic, but not everyone is convinced. If the first day of the first year was January 1, year 1, the end of the first year was December 31, year 1, and the end of that first decade was on December 31, year 10.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>Friends, it is with great pleasure that I welcome you back here to the Weekly

<p>(People even seem to think of this as the last year of the decade, which makes

December 31, year 1, and the end of that first decade was on December 31,
year 10. By this reasoning, the end of the current decade is still more than a
year away, on December 31, 2020. Yes, the calendar has changed drastically over the years, but the principle of when decades start and end is the same.)</p>
<p>Anyways, one thing I am only slightly more sure about is that this edition of
the WHV Monday looks back on the days from Monday December 9 to Sunday December
15, 2019!</p>

</figure>
<h2 id="we-are-load-shedding-again">We are load shedding again.</h2>
<p>So yeah, there&rsquo;s that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re load shedding again.</p>
<p>Everything I wrote &ldquo;<a href="/2019/03/24/weekly-head-voices-166-morgan-bay/#on-being-powerless">on being
powerless</a>&rdquo;
in March of this year is again happening, down to me spending more time on
Twitter again (DANG IT) searching for voices that might indicate justice
eventually being served.</p>
<p>In spite of the fact that our home is now more or less load-shedding-proof due
to it being for the largest part <a href="/2019/06/30/weekly-head-voices-172-abc/#solar-powerrrrrrrr">solar
powered</a> this time
around, the rotating power outages (we had a week or two of stage 4, i.e. 3 x
2.5 hour outages per day, and one evening of escalation to stage 6) are an
upsetting reminder of the decades-long and now continuing incompetence and
corruption of the country&rsquo;s leadership.</p>
<p>Apart from the numerous mental cycles this phenomenon has been <em>stealing</em> (see
what I did there) from my work focus, it is hard not to notice how businesses,
colleagues and friends are being hit by this.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s perhaps new this time, is that <a href="https://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2019-10-29-eskom-board-member-slams-interference-says-there-should-be-load-shedding/">it has been confirmed by an Eskom board
member</a>
that the same politicians who have caused this mess, are <em>still</em> meddling in
technical affairs they have no idea about, for all of the wrong reasons.</p>
<p>To put it quite bluntly, instead of trying to address the almost insurmountable
technical problems at the electricity supplier, it seems that the ruling party
(the ANC of course) for example insisted that the electricity be kept on at all
costs during the elections.</p>
<p>Numerous incidences of this sort of interference helped them to save face over
the years, at the cost of further debilitating the already fragile South
African economy.</p>
<p>At this moment, as large parts of industry are shutting down for the Christmas
period, we are enjoying a respite from load shedding.</p>
<p>We will see what happens in the new year.</p>
<p>The board member quoted above stated that if meddling had not been such a
concern, and they could face the technical problems head-on, we were looking at
at least 8 months of load shedding.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that the people would be able to deal with it if those cards were
simply laid on the table, without all of the political meddling and backroom
dealings.</p>
<p>As was the case the previous time, I do remain hopeful that the number of
spines in power grows, and that the electricity provider is able to focus all
of its energy on addressing the significant problems that it faces.</p>
<h2 id="time-restricted-eating-tre-with-black-coffee-please">Time-restricted Eating (TRE) with Black Coffee please.</h2>
<p>I think it was Reader K who introduced me to the idea of time-restricted
eating, or TRE, a year or two ago.</p>
<p>(Together we tried to figure out on which medium this happened, because under
normal circumstances I would have wanted to look up the exact time and contents
of the messages.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we discovered that it must have been via Facebook Messenger, and
somewhere between then and now Reader K had expunged their whole Facebook
history.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lesson in here somewhere, but we have to forge ahead, so
we&rsquo;re going to have to side-step it.)</p>
<p>Time-restricted eating, or TRE, is a sort of intermittent fasting where the
eating window is deliberately limited to an as short as possible duration
during the daytime.</p>
<p>The theory behind it is that our metabolism is in fact also ruled by the
all-powerful circadian clock.</p>
<p>During our long evolution, we would have been foraging and feeding during
daylight, and resting during the night.</p>
<p>With artificial light and the ubiquitousness of food of modern times, we easily
fall into the habit of starting to eat when we wake up, and having the last
snack shortly before going to sleep, hours after sunset.</p>
<p>In short, we really do eat too much, and to make it even worse, we eat at all
the wrong times.</p>
<p>With research around TRE, science, as is its wont, is showing us the way back
to redemption.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s starting to look like limiting one&rsquo;s feeding window to a few hours during
daylight could have a number of health advantages.</p>
<p>See for example:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4255155/">Time-restricted feeding is a preventative and therapeutic intervention
against diverse nutritional
challenges</a> - a 2014
Cell Biology study with mice.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/12/191205141731.htm">Clinical study finds eating within 10-hour window may help stave off
diabetes, heart
disease</a> - a 2019 Science Daily summary.</li>
<li><a href="https://m2performancenutrition.com/blog/can-time-restricted-feeding-make-you-fitter">Can time restricted feeding make you
fitter</a> -
a reasonable overview.</li>
</ul>
<p>After a debate with friend LM about whether black sugarless coffee constituted
a break of the TRE fast (I thought that it did due to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6KClPkotxM">this conversation
between Rhonda Patrick and Joe
Rogan</a>, friend LM did not, so I
initially did not even try TRE because I am unable to operate without black
coffee in the mornings), I have been dipping my toes in the TRE pool.</p>
<p>I have never been a breakfast person (&ldquo;Breakfast is the most important meal of
the day&rdquo; ??! TRUST NO ONE.), so sticking to black coffee in the mornings until
as late as possible, which is in many cases lunch, and not eating anything
after dark, has subjectively worked out pretty well so far.</p>
<p>Sometimes, shortly before lunch, there seems to be a slight delusional quality
to my seemingly enhanced mental clarity, but let&rsquo;s keep that between you and
me.</p>
<h2 id="anniversary-walk-up-the-mountain">Anniversary walk up the mountain.</h2>
<p>Recently, my life partner and I celebrated two decades of official
togetherness by walking up the Helderberg mountain.</p>
<p>We did not quite make West Peak, and we were pretty bushed by the end, but
that&rsquo;s ok. The scenery was epic, and getting back home was brilliant.</p>
<p>We will try again in 2029.</p>
