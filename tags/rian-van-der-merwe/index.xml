<p>In the week of Monday January 4 to Sunday January 10, at least the following things happened:</p>
<ul>
<li>I wrote four blog posts on this blog:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://cpbotha.net/2016/01/04/z-launcher-a-breath-of-fresh-air-in-the-world-of-android/">Z Launcher: A breath of fresh air in the world of Android.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://cpbotha.net/2016/01/05/note-taking-strategy-early-2016/">Note-taking strategy early 2016.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://cpbotha.net/2016/01/06/user-interface-boo-boo-1-disabled-controls/">User interface boo-boo #1: Disabled controls without explanations!</a></li>
<li><a href="https://cpbotha.net/2016/01/07/closure-expressions-in-swift/">Closure expressions in Swift.</a> This one got picked up by a really quiet corner of Reddit, and more visitors to this blog than it’s seen in a long time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Less nerdy readers (HI MOM!): Please skip the nerdy posts. My personal branding consultant has advised me to post everything here, and cross-post the longer technical articles on <a href="https://vxlabs.com/">vxlabs.com</a>.</li>
<li>Work started this week: I’m knee-deep back in C++, GLSL shader bugs, Swift, Metal and Python. FUN!</li>
<li>Four years ago, Scott Hanselman, prolific internet personality, <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/YourBlogIsTheEngineOfCommunity.aspx">explained quite eloquently</a> why it’s so important that we (nerd) blog more. Also, Rian van der Merwe <a href="https://twitter.com/RianVDM/status/683309344805371907">wants us to use 2016 to Make the Personal Blog Great Again™</a>. Iran’s blogfather <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/dec/29/irans-blogfather-facebook-instagram-and-twitter-are-killing-the-web">argues that Facebook, Instagram and Twitter are smothering the open web</a>. Although I think that the above-mentioned companies have done much good in helping many new humans onto the internet (Facebook: <a href="http://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/">more than 1.5 BILLION monthly active users</a> out of 7.3 billion humans total in 2015), we do have to put much more energy into cultivating the decentralised, non-siloed parts of this fantastic network that links all of us together.</li>
</ul>
<p>See you next week peeps, have fun!</p>
