PyColourChooser hacking. Michael Gilfix (the author) has integrated my patches. You know it’s a good patch when it removes far more code than it adds, yet increases the functionality. :)
I’m still wondering why wxWindows doesn’t wrap the GTK colour wheel though. The wxWindows generic colour selector (used on GTK setups) isn’t worth the photons it was coded with.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>In other news, I was able to put time in on Friday and do some</p>

<p>I’m still wondering why wxWindows doesn’t wrap the <a href="http://wxpython-users.1045709.n5.nabble.com/gtk-color-selection-td2289462.html">GTK colour wheel</a> though. The wxWindows generic colour selector (used on GTK setups) isn’t worth the photons it was coded with. PyColourChooser alleviates this deficiency in wxPython to some extent, but that durn colour wheel would have been nice too!</p>
