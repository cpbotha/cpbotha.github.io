<p>During the past week, I checked off 22 GTD tasks, spread over 10 projects.  Besides these, I had the usual 2 hours of lecture preparation, 3 hours of lecturing and 17 hours of scheduled meetings, including an absolute power networking event where I definitely was the smallest fish in the bowl (lovely that!).</p>
<p>If you are not of the nerdy persuasion, you might just want to skip the next few paragraphs until the bit with the backyard philosophy warning.</p>
<p>On the nerd front, I had a bit of a fight with my internet provider as to the stability of my line. They were full of confidence that my line needed to be throttled to 4 Mbit/s to be stable, I had a suspicion that I could get it stable at a significantly higher rate. Guess who’s the daddy? ME OF COURSE. My line is stable at 5.54 Mbit/s (I’m about 3.2 km from the exchange). I now know far more about ADSL line black magic than I ever wanted to.  Bottom line in this case is that, in cases where your line only manages between 4 and 6 Mbit/s, ADSL1 can be much more stable than ADSL2.</p>
<p>Further on the nerd front, <a href="http://cpbotha.net/2010/02/28/weekly-head-voices-15-auto-tune-my-cloud/" title="link to WHV where I get a month subscription">my month-long evaluation of Dropbox</a> has culminated in me signing on for a further year with a pro 50G account.  It’s just that good… Even furtherer, <a href="http://lastpass.com/" title="lastpass website">lastpass.com</a> has solved my last gripe with <a href="http://google.com/chrome" title="chrome website">Google Chrome</a>, namely that its stored password database is not encrypted. As part of the bargain, my passwords are now synchronized with the Cloud! Coupled with Chrome <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/firefox-chrome-opera,2558.html" title="Tom's Hardware review of 5 browsers (March 2010)">absolutely crushing most other browsers in speed tests</a>, and the fact that up to now it has <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5177709/chrome-the-only-browser-standing-in-pwn2own-contest" title="lifehacker article on pwn2own competition">proven extremely hard to hack</a>, this has pushed me over the edge, into the Wonderful Land of Full-time Dedicated Google Chrome Addicts.</p>
<p><strong>Warning: Excessive Backyard Philosophy Beyond This Point</strong></p>
<p>On Wednesday I arrived home, all stressed out about work. Yes dear readers, some academics, like me for instance, <em>sometimes stress out about work</em>. Somehow, I was born without the ability to separate work from personal life. Mostly, this is an advantage: I really love my job. It’s become more a way-of-life, a philosophy if you will, than just a job. However, sometimes this means that I have great difficulty switching off my work circuits when this is necessary, for example when work finds itself in High Stress Mode (HSM) and I need to be in Relaxed Family-Person Mode (RFPM). At the end of such a work day, my body is displaced from work to home, but the contents of my head remain exactly the same. In effect, I travel through <em>space</em>, but not <em>time</em>.</p>
<p>Back to Wednesday: Fortunately, fate conspired to arrange for me and my BBQ to meet, under a lovely early Spring sky. My BBQ is more than just a BBQ. I have recently come to the conclusion that it is a powerful magical artifact that is able to bend time (and space). Standing there admiring the glowing coals, everything came to a peaceful stand-still. Probably due to the severe time-warping slowing down the world, I could see the whole multi-dimensional life-landscape surrounding me in its true perspective.</p>
<p>It’s not all that.</p>
<p>Work is really important, and if that’s your passion, it should remain so.  It’s definitely mine. However, there’s more, and much of the more is even more important. I’ve made  this observation often enough before, but it’s one of those things that is apparent to my cognitive self, but somehow doesn’t have a permanent effect on my natural perception. Briefly on Wednesday evening, this realisation was clear. By Thursday the feeling was starting to disappear again.</p>
<p><strong>Epilogue</strong></p>
<p>Today I received the terribly sad news that a colleague, with whom I’d been working closely together for the past months, had unexpectedly passed away on Sunday, leaving behind a young family.</p>
<p>One has to learn how to <em>keep</em> things in perspective. Life is too short not to.</p>

<p>YOU WILL NOW BE RETURNED TO YOUR NORMAL PROGRAMMING.</p>
<p>The reason for the title of this post is my Saturday visit to <a href="http://dok.info/" title="DOK website">DOK</a>, Delft’s unique library concept. It’s not really a library, but more of a fantastic place of gathering that coincidentally contains thousands of books, CDs, DVDs and, err, a coffee shop! They even have a number of <a href="http://www.sonicchair.de/" title="Sonic Chair website">sonic chairs</a> that one can make use of to listen to music via the mounted Macs. This Saturday, live music by one of the artists who exhibited at the DOK.  I made you a short snippet:</p>

<p>As even this short edition should end on a philosophical note, I’d like to conclude with an interesting discussion I had on whether the type of research we do in (medical) visualisation can be considered to be science. Very strictly speaking, the scientific method consists of observation, hypothesis forming and finally experimentation to prove or disprove the hypothesis. A large body of visualisation work is concerned with <em>making stuff that solves hard problems</em>, i.e. formulative research as opposed to the more traditional evaluative research. Although the question of whether <em>making stuff that solves hard problems</em> constitutes science is a complex discussion that deserves a whole year of blog posts, I am going to conclude with one possible and simple take on situation:</p>
<p>By taking this constructive approach we are, besides actually solving problems (a neat by-product, no?), discovering <em>how</em> to create effective visual representations of complex phenomena hidden in even more complex data. By doing this, we are in fact observing the supremely complex system consisting of the whole pipeline from data acquisition to insight, all the while experimenting with parameters (in the widest possible sense of the world) and thus confirming or disproving hypotheses concerning the nature of the pipeline and its various components. Together, these hypotheses make up the model that governs the effective extraction of insight from data via the human visual system.</p>

<p>First I have to get some <strong>negative emotions</strong> off my chest: I’m currently <strong>test-driving the TU Delft’s new standard SuSE Enterprise Linux Edition (SLED) 11 image</strong> at work. After two days of using the system and documenting my experiences, I had to switch back to my usual Ubuntu desktop, as my eyes had started bleeding profusely. The SLED desktop takes the concept of “ugly” to places even it feels very dirty having ever visited. Okay, so I might be ever so slightly exaggerating, but there really is almost no comparison with a modern Ubuntu system!</p>
<p>During this past week my <strong>productivity has again made the transition from reactive to proactive</strong>. This is a usual phenomenon after any long vacation, but it sure is a nice feeling being able to start on things long before they become urgent. It gives me some room to strategise and think about the Big Picture. In the same vein, I (once again) realised that I should spend mornings on the creative and heavier-weight items on my todo list, and reserve the afternoons for meetings (which definitely require creativity, but of a different kind) and more routine tasks. For the past months I have followed the policy of scheduling meetings in the afternoons as far as possible, so my mornings are reserved for tasks that require a few hours contiguously. Luxury!</p>
<p>At the start of an evening with two friends (in line with my anonymisation policy, let’s call them Science Entrepreneur Friend, or SEF, and Extremely Clever Yet Very Social Scientist Friend, or ECYVSSF) that ended with me having so much fun that I managed to get caught on the infamous Dutch nachtnet (trains that take party-goers home at ungodly hours), SEF pointed out that my “to learn and to create” snippet of the <a href="http://cpbotha.net/2010/01/24/weekly-head-voices-10-loose-bits-sink-chips/" title="Link to previous post.">previous post</a> reminded him of something of <strong>Wilhelm von Humboldt</strong>. After some searching I found the [relevant quote][3]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To inquire and to create;—these are the grand centres around which all human pursuits revolve, or at least to these objects do they all more or less directly refer. Before inquiry can fathom the very essence of things, or penetrate to the limits of reason, it presupposes, in addition to profundity, a rich diversity and genial warmth of soul—the harmonious exertion of all the human faculties combined.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thank you SEF !</p>
<p>This same evening was characterised by, besides too many Pelgrim Trippels (a strong beer brewed in Rotterdam), much heated discussion on the interaction between <strong>science</strong>, that is how we attain and disseminate new knowledge about the reality around us, and <strong>academia</strong>, that is the interesting ecosphere where science mostly takes place, where scientists work in strange and strict hierarchical castes, and the focus on science can easily be lost due to the practicalities and politics of academia.</p>
<p>For all its faults, it is exactly this strange system that makes it possible for me to work closely together with a number of exceptionally bright people, an energising activity that is arguably very much in the spirit of inquiry and of creativity.</p>
<p>On that positive note, have a brilliant week everyone!</p>
