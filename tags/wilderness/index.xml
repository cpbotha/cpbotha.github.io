The last official WHV, by name, was WHV #253, published on September 2, 2023, although the 2023 to 2024 transition post certainly deserves its honorary WHV title.
In the meantime, I have been experimenting with the Daily Head Voices / lifelogs, which was fun, but ultimately not sufficiently meaty to fill the WHV vacuum.
We are clearly going through a pretty significant WHV-hiatus.
Although I&amp;rsquo;m still not sure what the new stable state is going to be, I have some extremely modest plans, and in addition to those I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to dust off and revive the draft of WHV #254 which was just lying there on my disc since September of last year, all languishing.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>Hello there WHV enjoyers, and welcome back! &hellip;ish.</p>

<h2 id="easter-break-on-the-garden-route">Easter break on the Garden Route</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m typing these words on my laptop in the family car, moving back home along the N2 after an absolutely fabulous Easter break-away on the Garden Route.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I have not yet figured out a safe way to drive and type at the same time, so my partner is graciously helping out with the driving bits during this shift.</p>
<p>GOU#1&rsquo;s exchange family &ldquo;sister&rdquo; from Germany is currently visiting, and so we have been doing our best to show her some of the best this amazing country has to offer.</p>
<p>Although this makes for a fairly jam-packed holiday programme (almost no time to work on hobby projects), it really has been loads of fun.</p>
<p>Some highlights (ask me in the comments if you&rsquo;re curious about anything):</p>
<ul>
<li>Ebb &amp; Flow rest camp in Wilderness - one of my favourite running routes next to the Serpentine river</li>
<li>Sun-down at Salinas Beach restaurant in Wilderness</li>
<li><a href="https://knysnaelephantpark.co.za">Elephant encounters at the Knysna Elephant Park</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.sanparks.org/parks/garden-route/camps/storms-river-mouth">Storms River Mouth rest camp (Tsitsikamma)</a> - beauty all round, hikes over the hanging bridges up past the view point, also the start of the Otter trail at the other end of the camp</li>
<li>Lunch at The Views in Wilderness</li>
<li>St Francis, beautiful as always, with specific mention of Etienne&rsquo;s surfing lessons at the main beach for our teenagers, and the super entertaining St Francis Bay canal sunset cruise</li>
<li>We were absolutely blessed with balmy later summer weather, except for one rainy morning in Storms</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="two-mention-worthy-personal-knowledge-tools">Two mention-worthy personal knowledge tools</h2>
<p>As is traditional around these parts, we have this nerdy section surprise here to talk about software tools that I really like, after which there will be some backyard philosophy sections.</p>
<h3 id="miniflux">miniflux</h3>
<p>My yearly <a href="https://www.inoreader.com">inoreader</a> rss reader subscription was up for renewal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really fantastic product that I&rsquo;ve been using (and paying for) for years as <a href="/2023/04/11/note-taking-strategy-2023/#mobile">a core part of my personal knowledge management approach</a>, but the renewal email and especially the price tag was a good reminder to review my options, especially since I already have an old Linux laptop serving <a href="https://pi-hole.net">Pi-hole</a> for family-wide ad-blocking, and <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io">Home Assistant</a> to track energy production and usage stats of some of our devices at home.</p>
<p>A few minutes of searching fortunately led me to <a href="https://miniflux.app">miniflux</a>, &ldquo;a minimalist and opinionated feed reader&rdquo;. After a few more minutes, I had the docker-compose up and running (miniflux and postgres containers), and after some more minutes I had a <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/products/tunnel/">CloudFlare tunnel</a> up so that I can easily access my miniflux&rsquo;s web UI from anywhere via an automatic Cloudflare-supplied SSL certificate. Finally, through the magic of OPML, it was straight-forward to move my 130+ feed subscriptions from inoreader to miniflux.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been using this setup for the past week or two and so far it looks like a strong keeper!</p>
<p>miniflux has extensive keyboard support on the desktop, but it works great on mobile, which is where I mostly use it.</p>
<p>I really like its minimalism: It shows me a paged view of all my feeds (page size configurable), via which I can easily jump to the source page, or use miniflux&rsquo;s built-in reader mode, and also easily toggle the whole page as read before moving on to the next.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in the market for a self-hosted RSS reader, take this as a strong recommendation for miniflux. Even if you don&rsquo;t want to self-host, <a href="https://miniflux.app/hosting.html">their $15 / year hosted offering</a> is probably worth a look.</p>
<h3 id="omnivore">omnivore</h3>
<p>After years of eschewing &ldquo;read-it-later&rdquo; apps like Pocket and friends for the more straight-forward but often klunky  <a href="/2019/03/21/weekly-head-voices-165-get-in-my-pocket/#replacing-pocket-with-just-a-bunch-of-pdfs-jbop">&ldquo;just print to PDF and store&rdquo; approach</a>, I had to give <a href="https://omnivore.app/">omnivore</a> a go, as it offered native support to sync article highlights into Obsidian&rsquo;s markdown, and I thought that I would be able to use this for my Emacs setup as well.</p>
<p>I was indeed able to co-opt the Obsidian integration to get saved article highlights into my Emacs setup, but in the process fell completely for the omnivore app as a whole.</p>
<p>On mobile, which is where I use this most, I am able to import any web-page or post into omnivore with two taps.</p>
<p>On average, it does a great job of extracting the article contents and rendering it in a far more consistent and reading-friendly way.</p>
<p>One can make different coloured highlights in any article, and even add a note to each highlight.</p>
<p>Finally, it also imports PDFs with aplomb, and offers most of its functionality there. There are additional subtle delights, like the fact that you can double-tap on one column of a multi-column PDF, at which point omnivore will zoom to bring only that column into maximum width view.</p>

<p>For me the only downside of omnivore is that it violates <a href="/2023/04/11/note-taking-strategy-2023/#high-level-overview">both my single search interface and plain old files on local drives characteristics</a>. However, both of these violations are partially mitigated by the aforementioned note-syncing feature. I don&rsquo;t really want to have <strong>all</strong> of my saved articles to be part of my database, so here I should make syncable highlights when something is important enough to go into the primary notes database.</p>
<p>After some months of use, I strongly recommend omnivore as your web-resource-ingestion-and-assimilation tool!</p>
<h2 id="the-three-or-four-hours-rule-for-getting-creative-work-done">The three-or-four hours rule for getting creative work done</h2>
<p>Last year, I listened to a short piece by Oliver Burkeman, who has <a href="/tags/oliver-burkeman/">featured on this blog a number of times</a>, which made an impression on me. I made a note of it in the pre-hiatus draft of this post, and then promptly forgot about it.</p>
<p>The core of Burkeman&rsquo;s three-or-four hours rule, which you can <a href="https://www.oliverburkeman.com/fourhours">read more about on his website</a>, is summarised in the following quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip; use whatever freedom you do have over your schedule not to &ldquo;maximise your
time&rdquo; or &ldquo;optimise your day&rdquo;, in some vague way, but specifically to ringfence
three or four hours of undisturbed focus (ideally when your energy levels are
highest).</p>
<p>Stop assuming that the way to make progress on your most important projects is
to work for longer. And drop the perfectionistic notion that emails, meetings,
digital distractions and other interruptions ought ideally to be whittled away
to practically nothing.</p>
<p>Just focus on protecting four hours – and don&rsquo;t worry if the rest of the day is
characterised by the usual scattered chaos.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have definitely suffered from the &ldquo;maximise your time&rdquo; bug and can attest to its negative effects.</p>
<p>Burkeman suggests to worry only about a core few high-focus hours (he says 3 or 4, I think sometimes depending on your context, even 1 could work) and let the rest be what it wants to be.</p>
<p>I think this is a far better approach which strongly complements <a href="/2021/01/26/weekly-head-voices-214-one-main-thing/#one-main-thing">the one main thing philosophy</a>.</p>
<p>P.S. There&rsquo;s another important tenet of Burkeman&rsquo;s approach, which he talks about in his post linked above, and which also <a href="/2021/08/20/weekly-head-voices-230-follow-your-blisters/#know-how-to-put-down-your-work">featured in WHV #230, namely: Know how to put down your work</a> (although I just noticed that back then I did not mention the chaos part&hellip;). In summary: Guard your focus hours, let &ldquo;the chaos&rdquo; fill the rest, but become really good at detaching and walking away at the end of the work day. Thank you <a href="http://noeskasmit.com">Noeska</a> for the reminder!</p>
<h2 id="the-magic-relationship-ratio-is-5-to-1">The Magic Relationship Ratio is 5 to 1</h2>
<p>I really enjoyed the <a href="https://lexfridman.com/shannon-curry/">fascinating podcast between Lex Fridman and Dr Shannon Curry</a>, a clinical and forensic psychologist, titled &ldquo;Johnny Depp &amp; Amber Heard Trial, Marriage, Dating &amp; Love&rdquo;, much of it in fact about human relationships (<a href="https://www.podcastworld.io/episodes/366-shannon-curry-johnny-depp-amber-heard-trial-marriage-dat-sz9ltosy">textual summary here</a>).</p>
<p>Among the many practical and science-based topics that Dr Curry talked about, she mentioned the <a href="https://www.gottman.com/blog/the-magic-relationship-ratio-according-science/">&ldquo;5 to 1magic relationship ratio&rdquo;</a>, which refers to the observation that the interactions between happy couples tend to consist of at least 5 positive interactions for each negative interaction.</p>
<p>It should come as no surprise that being able to spend decades together in a permanent state of happiness, by definition continuously facing various internal and external stressors in an often resource-constrained environment, is probably not realistic.</p>
<p>Thus I really like that this observation runs with the knowledge that almost no-one is going to get this right, and that the smart approach is instead to accept that and focus on what you can attain, namely, that more practical but still ambitious 5 to 1 ratio.</p>
<h2 id="ratio">Ratio</h2>
<p>This is the part of the post where I try to tie up some of the threads, or at least justify the title.</p>
<p>Burkeman&rsquo;s three-or-four hours rule is all about working towards a practical and healthy <em>ratio</em> between focus time and the rest of the daily chaos, instead of being continuously disappointed because it&rsquo;s not really possible to fill all of your days with pure focus hours.</p>
<p>The 5 to 1 ratio is the same: We make peace with reality, and work towards a healthy ratio between positive and negative interactions.</p>
<p>The third <em>ratio</em> I want to mention here refers to the Dutch word &ldquo;ratio&rdquo; (<a href="https://nl.bab.la/uitspraak/nederlands/ratio">pronunciation)</a>, one of whose definitions is &ldquo;reason&rdquo; or &ldquo;logic&rdquo;, or more idiomatically, the noun corresponding to adjective &ldquo;rationeel&rdquo;, which is the same as the English &ldquo;rational&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As with all things language, the use of this word implies subtle little differences. Whatever the case may be, I was delighted when I discovered that the Dutch had adopted the original Latin for this. To me it felt like that meant there was a special place for and focus on <em>ratio</em> in their world.</p>
<p>With that trifecta (a neologism, I just learned, for contrast!) of <em>ratio</em> examples, I think that I can now conclude this post with the earnest wish, for you and for me, that we are able to instantiate, maintain and propagate superb levels of <em>ratio</em>.</p>

<p>This is the year of me struggling to make the time and the energy to write
these posts. Between work (it&rsquo;s never been this truly busy before), family
(teenagers man) and other important activities, this previously
straight-forward endeavour has become really challenging.</p>
<p>I currently have no cunning plans to remedy this issue, except to keep on
trying.</p>
<p>Anyways, my main goal with this post below morphed from &ldquo;try to write a good
post&rdquo; to &ldquo;<em>any</em> post is better than no post&rdquo;, and so it is entirely possible that
you&rsquo;ll notice some unevenness.</p>
<h2 id="wilderness-energy">Wilderness Energy</h2>
<p>So after a number of paragraphs complaining about how little free time I have
at my disposal, I shall now briefly talk about our October family break-away to
the East coast!</p>
<p>As we often do, we decided to break the road-trip in two, staying for the night
in Wilderness, literally one of my favourite places on the planet.</p>
<p>As we don&rsquo;t often do, this time we stayed an extra night because the weather,
and that balmy Wilderness energy (it sounds like a pretty hip caffeinated
drink) were simply too amazing to pass up.</p>
<p>During our surprise extra day:</p>
<ul>
<li>I ran the Waterside dirt road next to the Serpentine river, in the direction of
Hoekwil. I love running dirt roads, and this one is high up on the list.</li>
<li>We (6 famjam + 1 friend) did the canoe trip at Kaaimanskloof, something that
we&rsquo;ve always dreamed about, to the waterfall, to the train bridge and later
up the river all the way to the bend right below the Map of Africa lookout,
far up above. I shared a canoe with my most favourite middle child in the
world, aka GOU #2. (We also won the race back, even beating out the far more
energetic canoe powered by GOU #1 and her friend, by applying a certain
degree of crystallized-intelligence-guided strategy.)</li>
<li>We squeezed in a beach day.</li>
<li>We went up to Map of Africa to enjoy the brilliant sunset.</li>
</ul>
<p>After all of that I was a bit worried that we had set the pace of the whole
week, the sustaining of which I would probably not have survived.</p>
<p>Fortunately the continuation of our vacation in St Francis was, whilst <em>quite</em>
active, an energetically more sustainable affair, consisting of balmy weather,
family beach days, and zen-inducing sunsets.</p>
<p>Personally, I will <em>remember</em> this week as a great example of How To Holiday.</p>

<h2 id="goldilocks-water-for-your-moka-pot">Goldilocks water for your Moka pot</h2>
<p>At home, we rely on our <a href="/2022/09/25/weekly-head-voices-246-call-up-your-friends/#coffee-machine-reincarnation">trusty (new) Saeco bean-to-cup</a> machine to keep us
continously and quite fully coffee-nated.</p>
<p>However, because there is no space for Saeco on our travels, we require a
mobile, preferably compact, coffee production modality.</p>
<p>This used to be the giant coffee syringe, also known as Aeropress, which I
wrote about in <a href="/2014/07/22/weekly-head-voices-78-aeroimpressed/">WHV #78, back in 2014</a>.</p>
<p>It makes really great tasting coffee, but it can feel a little clinical.</p>
<p>More recently, as we became older (a tenacious process that never seems to stop
until the end, I am told) and our appreciation for the slower, more deliberate
rituals of life grew, we decided to switch to a Bialetti Moka pot instead.</p>
<p>You would probably recognise it. It&rsquo;s that distinctive little aluminium pot
with the octagonal base and the friendly picture on the side.</p>
<p>Instead of the one minute stir, one minute push through of the Aeropress, this
artifact sits there on its hob for about five minutes when it magically fills
up with lovely espresso.</p>
<p>(Of course it&rsquo;s not magic, it&rsquo;s just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moka_pot">Mr Alfonso Bialetti&rsquo;s brilliant
engineering from 1933</a>!)</p>
<p>Here is our Moka pot, this time posing in <a href="/tags/stilbaai/">Stilbaai</a>, another one of my favourite
vacation destinations:</p>

<p>More recently, I chatted with friend PH at work about the ideal starting
temperature for the fresh water in one&rsquo;s Moka.</p>
<p>I had naively always preferred to start with cold water, to emulate the camping
situation, but work-friend explained that he had understood warm water to be
better for the taste.</p>
<p>I had never considered this before. Doh!</p>
<p>(Later I learned from mutual friend SvdW that they had in fact previously
studied Moka pot temperature in detail during a work trip, an experience
perhaps partially forgotten by friend PH.)</p>
<p>Serendipitously, during a meeting later that afternoon with colleagues from the
US, one of our collaborators, sporting a pretty relevant scientific background,
explained that <em>he</em> had understood (in Fahrenheit, we had to translate) that 60
°C resulted in the best coffee extraction.</p>
<p>This obviously piqued my curiousity, quite intensely, and so I went searching
that evening&hellip;</p>
<p>Imagine my delight when I ran into <a href="http://www.msc.univ-paris-diderot.fr/~phyexp/uploads/Moka/article1.pdf"><em>The physics of a stove-top espresso
machine</em></a>, a 2008 scientific article by Dr Warren D. King in the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1119/1.2870524"><em>American
Journal of Physics</em>, vol. 76, no. 6, pp. 558–565</a>, in which he documents his
mathematical modeling and experiments showing that the optimal starting
temperature for the water in a Moka pot is in fact 70 °C!</p>
<p>The short version of the story is that this will result in most of the water
going through the coffee grounds, when extraction takes place, at about 95
°C, which results in the most  flavour.</p>
<p>If you start with cold water, extraction will happen at 70 °C, which is
too low, and if you start with hot water, it will go through the grounds at too
high a temperature, resulting in bitter coffee.</p>
<h2 id="take-a-picture-with-your-mind">Take a picture with your mind</h2>
<!-- The title of this section is due to friend PK. You have to say it in his voice, "take a picture with your miiii-iiiiind!" -->
<p>Back in <a href="/2022/05/23/weekly-head-voices-242-multiplicity-of-me/#multiplicity-of-you">WHV #242 I talked about the remembering (narrating) self, and the
experiencing self</a>. (Please read that section if you have not yet. In fact, I
think that the whole of WHV #242 could be worth your time.)</p>
<p>Kahnemann&rsquo;s poignant quote bears repeating here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Odd as it may seem, I am my remembering self, and the experiencing self, who
does my living, is like a stranger to me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just the other day, in the middle of a perfect run on the beach, with a breeze
that was just <em>so</em>, the sun all golden and ready to set, and with my bare feet
connecting with the sand and the earth beneath it, it felt like a full sensory
connect, experiencing self for once fully in control.</p>
<p>It was perfect, until I felt this superficially pretty reasonable urge to take
a photo, just a little something to remember the perfect moment by&hellip;</p>
<p>At that instant, I saw it for what it was &ndash; sneaky, remembering self
attempting to hijack the moment, and take it away from experiencing self, the
one who at that moment was generating by far the most positive energy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We wants it, we needs it. Must have the precious. They stole it from us. Sneaky
little hobbitses. Wicked, tricksy, false! &ndash; JRR Tolkien</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The desire to remember the perfect moment is understandable, but there is a
cost: The moment itself.</p>
<p>Resist the urge.</p>
<p>Love,<br />
Remembering Self</p>

<p>This edition of the Weekly Head Voices, number two tenny eight, covers the
period of time from Monday June 28 to Sunday July 18 of the year 2021.</p>
<h2 id="bad-glitch-in-the-south-african-matrix">Bad glitch in the South African matrix</h2>
<p>Although I don&rsquo;t have much to say here (hence <a href="https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Komkommertijd">the title</a>), the country has been
all over the news for less than great reasons.</p>
<p>Shortly after former president Zuma finally finally handed himself over to the
police on Sunday July 4 to serve his 15 month jail sentence for contempt of the
Constitutional court (there are more cases to come), looting, arson and
violence broke out primarily in Kwazulu-Natal, but also in Gauteng.</p>
<p>Various shopes and malls have been stripped bare and/or destroyed.</p>
<p>This looked like a perfect storm, initiated by Zuma&rsquo;s incarceration (he has a
great deal of support in Kwazulu-Natal), partially fanned on by his children
and allies on social media, and intensified by systemic poverty.</p>
<p>There were many videos on social media of folks with luxury items, some trying
to stuff flat-screen TVs into their cars, or crossing the street with a basket
full of goods to dump in their luxury Mercedes, but there were also many more
who are only trying to survive under the poverty line and can&rsquo;t be blamed for
any of this.</p>
<p>As far as I can see, our current president Ramaphosa has for years now been
doing his best to unravel the nest of corruption and dishonesty that his party
the ANC has unfortunately become.</p>
<p>This is tricky work, as he needs to circumnavigate and/or defuse the same
internal forces that managed to oust president Thabo Mbeki and usher in the
terrible era of Zuma.</p>
<p>The poor man has had to endure even more flak in these days, both from his
political enemies and from other commentators.</p>
<p>Until convincingly shown otherwise, my opinion is that president Ramaphosa is
the best shot we currently have at a better future.</p>
<p>You can read <a href="https://www.gov.za/speeches/president-cyril-ramaphosa-update-security-situation-country-16-jul-2021-0000">his July 16 speech about the unrest here</a>.</p>
<p>A slight silver edge is that these events have put more pressure on the
<a href="https://businesstech.co.za/news/finance/506914/government-considers-basic-income-grant-after-riots-and-looting-in-south-africa/">discussions around the possible implementation of a basic income grant</a>.</p>
<p>P.S. It seems that the looting was not disruptive enough for some folks, and so
now we are dealing with <a href="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2021-07-20-why-the-western-cape-is-being-rocked-by-taxi-violence/">taxi-company-related violence in the Western Cape</a>.</p>
<p>P.P.S. let me just hide this here: far more locally, we are dealing with some
pandemic-related stressors.</p>
<h2 id="reserve-bench-holidays">Reserve bench holidays</h2>
<p>As <a href="/2021/06/30/weekly-head-voices-227-reality-bending-security-blanket/#groundhog-lockdown">I supected in the previous WHV</a> (three weeks ago, ahem&hellip;), our country&rsquo;s
struggles with the pandemic did in fact manage to get our Kruger National Park
visit cancelled.</p>
<p>To be clear, I have no illusions about the relative importance of our holiday
under these circumstances and in this context (close to utterly unimportant, in
other words), but we humans are gonna human and I&rsquo;m not gonna lie, we were
really looking forward to that week of sun in Mpumalanga.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve often said that the winter down here is more bearable than one would
expect, due to it being quite often punctuated by brilliant and sunny days
outside, but this year I&rsquo;ve come to realise that I might have underestimated
the positive effects of <a href="/tags/knp/">spending the darkest week under the sun of the North</a>.</p>
<p>Anyways, we were super fortunate to be able to arrange for a long weekend in
another one of our favourite places, namely Wilderness, where we were treated
with absolutely balmy days, some of them on the Touw river (inflatable SUPs
FTW!), some of them on the most beautiful beaches, and some of them hiking and
running on various trails.</p>

<p>If it sounds to you like we had to go outside every day to warm up in the
winter sun, I can hereby confirm your astute observation.</p>
<p>To be fair, this was literally in the deepest part of winter, from which there
is no true escape if one remains within the Western Cape.</p>
<p>In spite of that, or perhaps because of it, we enjoyed the wonderful days to
bits.</p>

HELLO FRIENDS!
Due to being outside so often, I have not been able to make the time to sit down and write to you more regularly over the past weeks.
I did miss you!
Fortunately, I am here now (that was Tuesday, it’s now Friday…) to babble a little bit about my subjective experience of the period of time from Monday September 17 to Sunday October 7. I did bring pictures!</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>HELLO FRIENDS!</p>
<p>Due to being outside so often, I have not been able to make the time to sit down and write to you more regularly over the past weeks.</p>
<p>I did miss you!</p>

<h1 id="gous-go-camping-for-their-first-time-ever">GOUs go camping for their first time ever.</h1>
<p>BFS decided to have his birthday party at a camp site called Beaverlac, close to Porterville. Beaverlac is beautiful and offers the additional amazing perk of No Cellular Reception.</p>
<p>The environment looks something like this:

</p>
<p>To my pleasant surprise, all three GOUs had a roaring time just being outside. Disconnection from the outside world was simply accepted as a given, which contributed significantly to their experience.</p>
<p>Before we move on to the next bit, a word to the wise: Your front wheel drive car will probably not be able to pull a trailer of any significant mass up the mountain when you leave Beaverlac. (There is only that one torturous way out, filled with thousands upon thousands of loose little stones…)</p>
<p>We learned this the hard way. Fortunately, the vehicle BFS had arranged for the weekend was an all-wheel drive, and so, after half an hour of hitching-unhitching-and-hitching again various trailers, we all managed to get back up to the top of the mountain.</p>
<h1 id="spring-break-in-wilderness">Spring break in Wilderness.</h1>
<p>The week after that, we left to spend a few days of the school spring break in Wilderness.</p>
<p>Having grown up in the Winelands, Wilderness is a whole different kind of pretty.</p>
<p>Wilderness has it all (say in <a data-rel="lightbox-video-0" href="https://youtu.be/NkdlM_vO3I8">Stefon voice</a> for maximum effect):</p>
<p>Verdant, all enveloping forests, rivers snaking everywhere, mountains and a beautiful coastline.</p>
<p>If they had called the place “LUSH” instead of “WILDERNESS”, that would also have been quite apt.

<h1 id="productivity-pro-tip-fool-yourself-into-doing-a-good-daily-review">Productivity pro-tip: Fool yourself into doing a good daily review.</h1>
<p>Many productivity systems, including GTD, recommend or sometimes even require that one performs a regular review of one’s task system. This always looks quite good on paper, but this activity somehow falls often and easily to the wayside.</p>
<p>In the latest evolution of my orgmode task management evolution, the checklist I mentioned in a <a href="/2018/01/07/weekly-head-voices-126-fleur-de-lis/">WHV #126</a> has become much more useful.</p>
<p>I now have a standard day planner template which I activate in the mornings by pressing a specific Emacs keyboard shortcut (C-c c p if you must know, it’s just an orgmode capture template).</p>
<p>This is a long(ish) checklist that ensures I review all of the important elements of my planning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Longer term goals and reminders which I update every month. This includes which books I want to finish reading, which longer term projects I need to think about, and so on.</li>
<li>My calendar for the day. Yes, I need to be reminded to double-check my calendar for any unexpected meetings.</li>
<li>The “00 ToDo” folder in my email. I sometimes move emails in there from my telephone. These need to be processed and turned into real todos.</li>
<li>The main list of orgmode tasks. These are extracted on-demand from my monthly journal and the various project files I maintain in orgmode.</li>
<li>macOS / iOS reminders. Don’t judge me. Sometimes I voice-command one of my iDevices that I should do this or that on this or that day, at which point they get added to the synchronised list of reminders. This review step ensures that I take care of those.</li>
</ul>
<p>The check list has an additional section with a list of habits that I try to build and maintain. This includes check list items for my sleep hours the previous night, the number of pomodori I complete (and whether I’m happy with that specific number) and whether I’ve read and thought enough for the day.</p>
<p>As with all of these systems, this one is far from perfect, but there are two things I specifically like about it:</p>
<ol>
<li>It takes a single keypress in the morning to create and configure the checklist.</li>
<li>Checklists are amazing. In this case, the checklist is helping me to pull reminders of various kinds from a range of different sources, which enables me to exert a just a little more control over my daily evolution.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="slippery-slippery-focus">Slippery slippery focus.</h1>
<p>Sometimes it feels like I have to spend the majority of my time just ensuring that I focus on the important stuff.</p>
<p>For an example, see the previous section.</p>
<p>A normal part of mindfulness meditation, is recognising when your attention wanders, and then just bringing your attention back to the breath.</p>
<p>In spite of the fact that this is an extremely well-known aspect of mindfulness, it has taken me until fairly recently to make peace with the fact that my normal daily focus (although sometimes it somehow finds itself in flow, which is amazing when it happens) will in many cases follow the same pattern.</p>
<p>Like many of you, I have the feeling that there’s an extremely complicated equation describing the relationship between sleep, diet, mood, time of day, environment, and so on, on the one hand and sustained focus on the other. I have an extremely rough idea how many of these affect focus, but on many days, experience breaks all of the rules.</p>
<p>Long story short, until we figure out how exactly to manipulate focus, I accept that the best way to handle the slippery focus problem, is, just like in mindfulness, to accept that it will never really stop wavering, and rather to work on recognising this wavering, and then simply bringing that focus back.
