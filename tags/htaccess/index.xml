<p>I started using CloudFlare’s free tier on this blog, before Let’s Encrypt burst onto the scene, mostly for their <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-universal-ssl/">universal SSL</a>. However, as joepie91 <a href="http://cryto.net/~joepie91/blog/2016/07/14/cloudflare-we-have-a-problem/">recently pointed out</a>, this means that by design, CloudFlare has to decrypt all SSL traffic, and then re-encrypt it to send it to your original site with its self-signed or generic certificate (in my case). Apart from this, CloudFlare is a bit of overkill for this low-traffic site.</p>

<p>Because I don’t need much of an excuse to try out something new, I used this as my excuse to try out <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let’s Encrypt</a>, a fantastic new(ish) service which issues free 90 day certificates to anyone who can verify their domains.</p>
<p>I was shocked with how easy this was on the webfaction shared (non root) hosting I’ve been using for years, and so I had to share.</p>
<p><strong>WITNESS THE GREAT EASINESS:</strong></p>
<h2 id="step-1-install-acmesh">Step 1: Install acme.sh</h2>
<p>These two steps are to be performed whilst SSH’d in to your web host.</p>
<p>First we install <a href="https://github.com/Neilpang/acme.sh">the wonderful acme.sh</a> by following the one-liner on its website:</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;&lsquo;shell
curl <a href="https://get.acme.sh">https://get.acme.sh</a> | sh
&rsquo;&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>At this junction, as they say, it’s best to log out and in again, so that the acme.sh alias and environment variable can be setup.</p>
<h2 id="step-2-issue-shiny-new-ssl-certificate">Step 2: Issue shiny new SSL certificate</h2>
<p>We then get <code>acme.sh</code> to verify the website using the webroot method, and to request a certificate for the two domains <code>cpbotha.net</code> and <code><a href="https://www.cbbotha.net">www.cbbotha.net</a></code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#586e75;background-color:#eee8d5;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="display:flex;"><span>acme.sh --issue -d cpbotha.net -d www.cpbotha.net -w ~/webapps/wp
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The argument following <code>-w</code> is the directory exposed by the website <code><a href="http://cpbotha.net/">http://cpbotha.net/</a></code>. Note that this is still <code>http</code>; Let’s Encrypt queries a special file left there by acme.sh to confirm that you actually manage the specified domain.</p>
<p>After a few seconds of progress output, I was left with a shiny certificate (as well as the CSR, key, and so forth) in <code>~/.acme.sh/cpbotha.net/</code></p>
<h2 id="step-3-install-shiny-new-ssl-certificate">Step 3: Install shiny new SSL certificate</h2>
<p>On Webfaction, one has to file a support ticket for this. My request was formulated thusly, and was correctly acted upon in about 5 minutes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Could you please install the following SSL certificate for the website cpbotha_SSL – reachable at <a href="https://cpbotha.net/"><a href="https://cpbotha.net/">https://cpbotha.net/</a></a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>cert is in <code>/home/cpbotha/.acme.sh/cpbotha.net/cpbotha.net.cer</code></li>
<li>key is in <code>/home/cpbotha/.acme.sh/cpbotha.net/cpbotha.net.key</code></li>
<li>intermediate CA cert is in <code>/home/cpbotha/.acme.sh/cpbotha.net/ca.cer</code></li>
<li>full chain certs is there: <code>/home/cpbotha/.acme.sh/cpbotha.net/fullchain.cer</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks!</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="update-on-2016-10-25">Update on 2016-10-25</h3>
<p>It is now possible to install the new certs all by yourself using the webfaction panel or the API! Read the <a href="https://blog.webfaction.com/2016/09/manage-ssl-certificates-with-the-control-panel/">announcement blog post</a> for more information.</p>
<h2 id="bonus-level-in-90--k-days-simply-re-run-acmesh">Bonus level: In 90 – k days, simply re-run acme.sh</h2>
<p>At any point, you can request certificates for any other domains that you may be hosting on your webfaction.</p>
<p>At regular intervals, or in slightly fewer than 90 days, simply run:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#586e75;background-color:#eee8d5;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="display:flex;"><span>acme.sh --renewAll
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>To have acme.sh renew any of your certificates that are up for renewal. Just remember to create a new support ticket to have the renewed certificates installed for the relevant domains.</p>
<h3 id="acmesh-cronjob">acme.sh cronjob</h3>
<p>Unbeknownst to be (I should have read the docs) acme.sh had cleverly installed a user cronjob to check for renewals. When I attempted to renew two of my certs, I saw that it had already done so automatically, so I only had to install the updated versions.</p>
<h2 id="boss-level-htaccess-based-redirect-from-http-to-https">Boss level: htaccess-based redirect from HTTP to HTTPS</h2>
<p>Now that I have my SSL setup, I would prefer for users who go to the HTTP site to be 301 forwarded to the HTTPS version. On Webfaction, I can do that with the following addition to the site <code>.htaccess</code> file:</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-html">&lt;<span style="color: #93E0E3;">IfModule</span> mod_rewrite.c&gt;
RewriteEngine On
# we're behind nginx ssl proxy, hence the non-standard check for no-SSL:
RewriteCond %{HTTP:X-Forwarded-SSL} !on
RewriteRule (.*) https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]
&lt;/<span style="color: #93E0E3;">IfModule</span>&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<b>Important:</b> webfaction is using nginx as their SSL frontend, so we check for the X-Forwarded-SSL header.
