Mostly bunches of ugly new hacks to work around some of the ugly old hacks in wlziipsrv. Scenic Clarence Drive route home, stopped at Café Zest in Gordon&amp;rsquo;s Bay for dinner. Yellowtail there was absolutely amazing! (thanks to GOU#1 who picked this jewel of a restaurant and made a reservation for us, all from the car) At home, finally got wlziipsrv built. Am secretly hopeful it might even work. (need to hook it up to supervisord, then nginx, then all of the microscopy data)</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <ul>

The sight was so spectacular, that we could not spare a second to get our cameras out, so you’re going to have to be satisfied with this photo of me and GOU #1 admiring the pod as they swam out of sight.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>On Sunday, April 10, 2016, as if the day was not already perfect enough, we were super fortunate to see a pod of dolphins speeding along in the sea right next to the R44 coastal road.</p>

<p>(The level and amount of human excitement on the sides of the road was also something to experience.)</p>
<p>The photo still includes its EXIF GPS information, but here’s a map showing the exact location of the sighting for your interest:</p>
