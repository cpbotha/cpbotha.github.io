<p>Haskell vineyard has made previous appearances on this blog in <a href="/2015/08/23/weekly-head-voices-99-no-lands/">WHV #99 in 2015</a>, in <a href="/2019/10/17/weekly-head-voices-181-the-slow-ones/">WHV #181 in 2019</a> and perhaps in other posts.

<h2 id="why-im-definitely-not-taking-part-in-advent-of-code-2024">Why I&rsquo;m definitely not taking part in Advent of Code 2024</h2>
<p>I tried to <a href="/2020/12/12/weekly-head-voices-211-table-mountain-run-ish/#advent-of-code-2020">explain The Advent of Code in WHV #211</a>, back in December of 2020 when I took part for the first time.</p>
<p>An extract from that explanation pertinent to this discussion is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To my non-programmer friends: Solving puzzles is like concentrated cat nip to programmers. In the case of AoC, you get unadulterated puzzle solving, and none of the other complications of writing production software.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The dark side of that property is that as the puzzles get more difficult and take up increasing amounts of time, the cat nip enjoyer can get locked in and have great difficulty even noticing that they are spending hours every day writing computer programmes when at first other people are working and later, down here, they are outside enjoying their summer vacation.</p>
<p>In 2020, I think it was on day 21 that I noticed after more than four hours on that day&rsquo;s puzzle that it was probably time to put down the keyboard.</p>
<p>Since then I have been carefully enjoying the first few days of each year&rsquo;s AoC, taking care to walk away when the cat nip becomes too strong.</p>
<p>This year I had resolved not to take part at all, as there are a number of important work projects and personal obligations to take care of.</p>
<p>However, my resolve broke on the first day when I thought &ldquo;What could be the harm in just taking a little peek?&rdquo;. That little peek led to a little solution, and then another, and then another day, and so on.</p>
<p>Anyways, as you can see from my <a href="https://bsky.app/hashtag/AdventOfCode?author=charlbotha.com">#AdventOfCode tagged posts on Bluesky</a>, I am not officially taking part, I&rsquo;m just submitting solutions every day.</p>
<p>On a more serious note: I am happy not to miss out on the AoC loads of fun, especially the banter and comparisons and learning on various chat groups, but I am really trying to keep a critical eye on the daily time expense. If it gets out of hand, I will walk away from the programmer cat nip.</p>
<p>P.S. Today was particularly fun, precisely because I managed to squeeze the puzzle in between more important activities. The little rush when I submitted part 2&rsquo;s solution minutes before we had to leave for lunch was exquisite.</p>

<h2 id="webp-ftw">WebP FTW</h2>
<p>Back in 2020, friend <a href="https://mentat.za.net/">Stéfan</a> and I <a href="/2020/05/02/drop-in-replacement-for-hugo-figure-shortcode-with-responsive-img-srcset/">hacked and slashed together a Hugo shortcode to render srcset images</a>.</p>
<p>In short, this adds multiple resolutions of each image in such a way that users download only what makes sense on their displays, often leading to faster page loading.</p>
<p>Fast forward 4 years as I try out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebP">WebP</a> format images on this website (always for faster loading!) and run into a disappointingly long-standing bug in the Go standard library&hellip;</p>
<p>Another long story short, our <a href="https://gist.github.com/cpbotha/deb310eed14308fe26f7b7d0fabeb34d?permalink_comment_id=5299293">figure shortcode can now work around this bug</a> by displaying webp, but using png/jpg behind the scenes for all conversions, meaning most images should load faster for you.</p>
<p>The photo at the top of this post should have the WebP format, and thanks to srcset it should download lower resolution versions if you are on a smaller display.</p>
<h2 id="why-im-starting-to-write-these-more-regularly-in-hugo-vs-orgmode">Why I&rsquo;m starting to write these more regularly in Hugo vs Orgmode</h2>
<p>This is just a quick note to me, and perhaps others who occupy this same nanoscopic technical niche.</p>
<p>For the past few years, <a href="/2020/05/03/weekly-head-voices-193-covid-19-part-3/#fantastic-blogging-tools-and-where-to-find-them">since May of 2020</a>, I&rsquo;ve been writing most of the WHV posts, and posts for my other blogs, in Emacs Orgmode, exporting them with the wonderful ox-hugo tool.</p>
<p>It made a great deal of sense to me (and it still does!) that my WHV entries were just entries in my monthly orgmode file.</p>
<p>However, sometimes when I go back to update a post from a few years back, some evolution in my orgmode configuration over the years complicates the orgmode to Hugo markdown process, and I&rsquo;m relegated to debugging the issue before I can get down to the actual update.</p>
<p>A year or two back, to lessen the impact of this problem, I started creating standalone org files for the WHVs. Whilst this certainly reduces the error surface, it&rsquo;s not as robust as editing the markdown directly, which I&rsquo;m doing right now.</p>
<p>Thanks for coming to my TED talk.</p>
<h2 id="on-waiting">On waiting</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>There&rsquo;s no such thing as waiting &ndash; only unexpected extra time to practice being present. &ndash; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Chozen_Bays">Jan Chozen Bays</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>P.S. In American English, practice is used both as verb and as noun, unlike British English which uses practice as a noun, and practise as the verb. Dr Bays is American, so I&rsquo;m keeping the spelling.</p>

<p>I finally got around to buying and reading <a href="http://37signals.com/remote/">REMOTE: Office not Required</a> by Fried and Heinemeier Hansson, founders of 37signals. 37signals is the company that brought us the hipster web-framework of choice, Ruby on Rails. As if producing RoR, having a turnover of a few million dollars per year and writing the best-seller <a href="http://37signals.com/rework/">book REWORK</a> was not enough, they had to go and write yet another bestseller documenting their experiences building a company based on mostly remote-working employees.</p>
<p>The book is full of valuable messages; Even if you’re absolutely NOT into remote working (yet), many of these observations apply to the office situation and can be used to improve matter. I’d like to summarise some of them very briefly in this post. Please discuss in the comments!</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>
    It seems that managers are under the impression that if they can see you at the office typing away, that you must be working, and conversely, that if you’re not there, you’re most probably goofing off. Let me start with HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA LOL LOL LOL LOLS. (that was me, not the book. For more lols, go to <a href="http://hackertyper.com/">hackertyper</a>, preferably in chrome, press F11 for fullscreen, and just type away on the keyboard as if you’re a monkey.) What the book explains very diplomatically, is that goofing off can happen anywhere, <b>especially</b> under the noses of said managers. A situation where employees are self-motivated, and know that they get judged on their actual output and not the amount of noise they make, is obviously desirable.
  </li>
<li>
    Working remotely, communication is for the largest part limited to channels that are controlled by <i>both</i> sender and receiver. In other words, employees get to determine when they get interrupted or not, by scheduling email or chat activity. This also means that one pays more attention to information that gets sent to and fro. Remember that interruptions are absolutely <b>toxic</b> to people in the zone. In an office environment, it’s hard to resist the temptation of walking over to colleague X and interrupting them with a question that could have waited until said colleague was ready to be interrupted. This is something that I’ll definitely try to apply at the new offices: Try to limit communication to chat and email, only interrupt people when it’s clear that they are interruptible.
  </li>
<li>
    They compare meetings to salt. When salt is used sparingly, it does wonders for your food. Too much, and everything is spoilt. In the remote situation, meetings do happen, but because they have to be planned much more carefully, they are perceived to be much more valuable, and the signal to noise ratio is much higher than is usually the case.
  </li>
<li>
    37signals must be great employer. Besides all the other perks, they pay <i>all</i> of their employees big city salaries, even those that choose to work from lower cost rural areas. One of the important advantages for companies supporting remote working, as that they get to pick the most talented people, no matter what geography thinks. Paying everyone the same big city salary, means that they have shown an incredibly high employee and talent retention.
  </li>
<li>
    By getting your remote game on, you can eliminate and/or alleviate a whole bunch of commute problems. This is great for the employees in question (more time, less road rage), for the environment, for the company (more effective work time), but even for your fellow humans who really, for some or other reason, do need to be on the road during peak hours.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>There’s much more in the book, but these are the issues that my memory decided to retain. I’m not convinced that 100% remote is the final answer though. Personally, I go to the office every day because I want to (I really don’t have to): There are a bunch of great people and friends hanging out together futzing on their computers in an awesome new lair and there’s a great deal of knowledge diffusion going on. I <em>do</em> think that having one’s systems and protocols configured fully to enable mixed remote working when convenient or required would give one a significant competitive edge.</p>
