<p>After some scratching around on <a href="http://www.takealot.com/">Takealot.com</a>, our otherwise wonderful local Amazon-analogue, I settled on the Awei A990-BL Wireless Sport Bluetooth Earphones.</p>
<p>After just under a month of real-world testing of these earphones (that is, running with them a few times a week, they are “sport” earphones after all), punctuated by disappointing performance and some mechanical breakage, and culminating in complete hardware failure, I can make only this very simple recommendation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DO NOT under any circumstances buy the Awei A990-BL Wireless Sport Bluetooth Earphones. They have attained the rarely awarded “cpbotha.net THREE (3) thumbs down, avoid at all costs” review.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="a-complete-set-of-accessories">A complete set of accessories</h1>
<p>I was pretty happy when the the earphones arrived on November 15, right on time, and with a pretty complete set of accessories:</p>

<p>None of the three sets of silicone earbuds were large enough for my ears, an issue that was easily solved by using a set of my old Sennheiser buds. My last Skullkandy earphones had the same issue, so I’m ascribing it to my anatomy and not to Awei.</p>
<h1 id="ear-clips-break-easily">Ear clips break easily</h1>
<p>During the first run with these earphones in the wind (when one also really notices how the control unit, a few centimetres from one’s right ear, can really flop around), I realised that the curved ear hooks were definitely necessary. For the next few runs, I had them clipped onto the earphones and they made a huge difference keeping music in my ears.</p>
<p>However, at the start of another run, I slight re-adjustment of the hooks relative to the earphones caused both of the earbud attachment bits to break clean off, rendering these accessories completely useless. I used a reasonable amount of force, and have to conclude that these clips are just not well made:</p>

<h1 id="bluetooth-transmission-hiccups">Bluetooth transmission hiccups</h1>
<p>Besides the breakage, I also noticed from the start regular little breaks in the music transmission from the Gear Fit 2 to my ears. It’s possible that these were somehow caused by the unit’s movement during my exercise. I take this opportunity to remind the reader of the “sport” classification of this Awei product.</p>
<p>It could also be that the Gear Fit 2’s bluetooth implementation is sub-par, but, unlike the Awei, it’s an a-list product. In the following weeks I will be able to test this hypothesis with alternative hardware.</p>
<h1 id="complete-hardware-failure">Complete hardware failure</h1>
<p>About 25 calendar days after purchase, the unit spontaneously died during a run, a disappointment in itself. At first I thought that it was simply the battery that was exhausted. However, no amount of charging back home could revive the earphones.</p>
<p>My Awei A990-BL earphones remain completely dead to this day.</p>
<h1 id="quo-vadis-emptor">Quo vadis emptor?</h1>
<p>After two failed attempts, first with the Bluedio Ci3 and then with these Awei headphones, I have decided to go a different route with the <a href="http://www.androidcentral.com/hands-samsung-level-link-wireless-adapter">Samsung Level Link bluetooth adapter</a>.</p>
<p>I’ll be able to use any wired earphones (at a much better price-performance ratio, and also much easier to replace) and just plug them into the Samsung Level Link, which will connect wirelessly to the Gear Fit 2.</p>
