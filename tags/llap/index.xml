<p>On the topic of not-too-shabby settings for meetings, I finally got around to visiting <a href="http://www.truthcoffee.com/">Truth Coffee</a> in Cape Town, <a href="http://travel.uk.msn.com/photos/the-best-coffee-shop-in-the-world">described by some</a> as <em>The best coffee shop in the world</em>. I was too busy having a good meeting, enjoying the superb coffee, and generally gawking at the fantastic interior and the pretty people (guests and staff) to take any photos, so you’re going to have to take me on my word and check <a href="http://www.thisiscolossal.com/2013/09/truth-steampunk-coffee-shop/">some of the photos floating around on the web</a>.</p>
<p>In between coffee, beer and meetings, I wrote two short nerdy posts at the vxlabs:</p>
<ul class="org-ul">

</ul>
<p>It was pretty awesome to hear that <a href="http://io9.com/5963263/how-nasa-will-build-its-very-first-warp-drive">NASA is thinking pretty seriously about developing a warp drive</a>, with which a ship would we able to traverse space at effectively faster than light speeds. It would do this without <em>locally</em> exceeding the speed of light by warping space around the travelling ship, contracting spacetime before the moving ship and expanding it behind it. The ideas are based on a paper by Miguel Alcubierre from 1994 titled <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/0264-9381/11/5/001"><em>The warp drive: hyper-fast travel within general relativity</em></a>, and so this gets to be called the Alcubierre Drive!</p>
<p>Well now they’ve gone and <a href="http://io9.com/heres-nasas-new-design-for-a-warp-drive-ship-1588948192">published artist’s impressions</a> of what such an Alcubierre Drive-equipped ship could look like, and it’s gorgeous!</p>

<p>These are pretty exciting times.</p>
<p>I’m going to end this post with an acronym I embarrasingly only learnt the meaning of yesterday: LLAP!</p>
