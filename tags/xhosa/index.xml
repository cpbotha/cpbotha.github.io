I’m a very slow learner, partly because isiXhosa doesn’t fit in any of my existing Germanic or Romantic (I only have a smattering of this, but it’s there) language frameworks. However, it’s loads of fun, so I decided this had to go on my blog.
There will be absolutely no structure to these lessons. I’m planning to put posts up more or less when I think it’s going to be fun to do so.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>One of my colleagues at <a href="http://stonethree.com/">Stone Three</a>, Ernestine, is teaching me isiXhosa. I’m a very slow learner, partly because isiXhosa doesn’t fit in any of my existing Germanic or Romantic (I only have a smattering of this, but it’s there) language frameworks. However, it’s loads of fun, so I decided this had to go on my blog.</p>
<p>There will be absolutely no structure to these lessons. I’m planning to put posts up more or less when I think it’s going to be fun to do so. At some point I might even post a sound recording or two, and then you can laugh at my attempt to reproduce the different types of click sounds in isiXhosa.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Ernestine taught me how to talk about the weather!</p>
<p>If it’s warm, one says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>kushushu</p>
</blockquote>
<p>meaning “it’s warm”, pronounced as <em>koo-SHOO-shoo</em>.</p>
<p>When it’s cold (as is currently the case down here, well relatively speaking of course), one could say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>kuyabanda</p>
</blockquote>
<p>meaning “it’s cold”, and pronounced as <em>koo-yah-BAN-da</em>.</p>
<p>When it’s raining, the phrase is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>kuyanetha</p>
</blockquote>
<p>meaning “it’s raining”, and pronounced as <em>koo-ya-NET</em> (the a is not pronounced).</p>
<p>That’s everything I acquired yesterday. Have fun practising!</p>
<p>Salani kakuhle!</p>
<p>P.S. Usually these kinds of posts begin with greetings in the new language. These ones don’t. Because.</p>
<p>P.P.S. Check out this fun music clip about learning isiXhosa by Craig Charnock, “Quite a White Ou”:</p>
