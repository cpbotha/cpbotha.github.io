In spite of my hip niggle but because of great weather, decided to do a normal weekday run. Due to family&amp;rsquo;s beach plans, I ended up for the most part on a coastal hiking trail which was amazing! Family Christmas (buffet) lunch at Joe Fish. The food was so amazing that I might have eaten a a tad or three too much. I think this is what folks in the US feels like after Thanksgiving. Drove (relaly slowly) back home to recover&amp;hellip; &amp;hellip; and to continue with https://github.com/cpbotha/org-roam-to-apple-notes After switching back to built-in HTML export with some hacks, results are looking much better. Rest of my 1800 notes are being exported as we speak.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <ul>
