<p>The conference was held in the historically and scientifically significant <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harnack_House" title="Wikipedia article on the Harnack House">Harnack House</a>, located in the academia-dominated Dahlem district of Berlin.  For a time, the Harnack House was the home of brilliant German scientists such as Einstein, the guy who invented the dish-washer (as you all know).  The unique setting definitely contributed to the particularly unique feel of this year’s event.</p>
<p><a href="http://graphics.tudelft.nl/~stef/" title="Stef Busking's work homepage">Stef</a> did a sterling job presenting our paper on the scientific comparison of Smurfs (will add link to paper later):</p>

<p>In spite of the importance of Smurf comparison, the best paper award was awarded to our friends from Swansea for their work on the <a href="http://www.cs.swan.ac.uk/~csbob/research/biologySensor/" title="Link to paper + movies of Eurovis 2009 best paper.">Visualisation of Sensor Data from Animal Movement</a>!  Remember to keep an eye out for our soon-to-appear InfoVis 2009 paper on the same topic, in cooperation with them.</p>
<p>Other papers / presentations that somehow stuck with me are (this is mostly due to my medvis bias and is not any reflection on the quality of the papers I do NOT list):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/research/publications/2009/bruckner-2009-IVV/" title="Link to MIDA paper">Instant Volume Visualization using Maximum Intensity Difference Accumulation</a> by Bruckner and Gröller (Vienna): By a continuous combination of DVR and MIP, this technique overcomes problems of both techniques.  Minimal futzing with transfer functions, better depth than MIP, 35% improvement!</li>
<li>Map Displays for the Analysis of Scalar Data on Cerebral Aneurysm Surfaces (no link available yet) by Neugebauer, Gasteiger, Beuing, Diehl, Skalej and Preim (<a href="http://cpbotha.net/2009/04/25/my-first-sabbatical/" title="magdeburg sabbatical posting">Magdeburg</a>): This is a great example of combining 3D with 2D to effectively visually represent complex simulation data.  Also, much like our shoulder work, this is a text book example of the medical visualisation pipeline (acquisition, image processing, simulation / modelling, visualisation / interaction, evaluation).</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="http://www.zib.de/eurovis09/?page_id=689" title="Eurovis 2009 capstone webpage">capstone</a> on Friday by <a href="http://www.mpibpc.mpg.de/home/grubmueller/ihp/hgrubmu/index.html" title="Website Grubmueller">Helmut Grubmüller</a> on <em>Watching Biomolecular Nanomachines at Work</em> was inspiring.  Besides the fact that he seems to publish papers with beautiful visualisations in Science every second week, he’s a fantastic speaker who was able to impress on us his wonder at these almost unfathomably tiny protein-component machines, with their rotating axes and all.  Here’s another bad mobile phone photo of the man in action:</p>

<p>P.S. Of course our paper wasn’t <em>really</em> on Smurf comparison.</p>
<p>P.P.S. <a href="http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~pneumann" title="Petra Isenberg's homepage">Petra Isenberg</a> (winner of the 3d best paper award!) and Christopher Collins made <a href="http://infosthetics.com/archives/2009/06/eurovis_2009_conference_coverage.html" title="Link to Information Aesthetics Eurovis 2009 write-up.">a really cool and detailed write-up of Eurovis 2009</a> (slightly infovis-biased) at Information Aesthetics.</p>
