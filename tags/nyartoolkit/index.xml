<p>I’ve called it NyARMultiBoard, and you can use it instead of the default NyARBoard if you want to track multiple markers.</p>
<p>Download a ZIP file containing everything (source code, jar files) from <a href="http://cpbotha.net/files/nyar4psg_multimarker/" title="Link to NyARMultiBoard archive">this directory</a>.  If you unpack this into your processing sketchbook/libraries directory, it should work out of the box.  It’s a drop-in replacement for NyAR4psg, so you don’t need to have that installed as well. There is an example to get you started in NyAR2/example/NyARMultiTest.  Note: This uses the GSVideo capturing stack as I explain <a href="http://cpbotha.net/2010/03/04/processing-gsvideo-nyartoolkit-on-linux-x86_64/" title="howto getting gsvideo going on x76_64">here</a>, you should easily be able to change it back to processing defaults (just change GSCapture to Capture).</p>
<p><em>Please let me know in the comments if this works (or doesn’t) for you!</em></p>
<p>I made this screencast to demonstrate the multiple marker tracking, assisted by <a href="http://cpbotha.net/2009/09/20/weekly-head-voices-4-the-new-roomie-medvis-at-mevis-fairy-tale-beach/" title="The New Roomie blog">TNR</a>:</p>

<p><strong>If you’re really into the details</strong></p>
<p>I’ve just added two new classes NyARMultiBoard and NyARMultiBoardMarker to the default NyAR4psg distribution. Very importantly, NyARToolkit itself needs to be patched with one extra method in NyARDetectMarker, see the NyARMultiBoard comments.</p>
<p><strong>Update on 20110304</strong></p>
<p>I’ve fixed the problematic frame bug in gsvideo that many of you have been running into. See <a href="http://cpbotha.net/2011/03/04/i-crushed-the-gsvideo-problematic-frame-error/" title="post with gsvideo problematic frame error fix">this post</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update on 20110305</strong></p>
<p>I’ve updated NyAR2 so it works with the P3D renderer as well, which is often faster for blitting the webcam image onto the display. The updated zip file is named NyAR2-20110305.zip, and it can be downloaded from the <a href="http://cpbotha.net/files/nyar4psg_multimarker/" title="NyAR2 multimarker download directory.">usual directory</a>. My changes are based on NyAR4psg 0.3.0 and NyARToolkit 2.5.2.</p>

<p>Today’s challenge is getting whole stack, including processing, the GSVideo video capture library for processing and the NyARToolkit augmented reality for processing going on Linux x86_64 (64bit).  On Linux x86 (32bit) this is much more straight-forward, but I wouldn’t write a blog post about straight-forward, now would I?</p>
<p>Here is the recipe:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Make sure you have the native 64bit Sun JDK installed for your system.  On this Ubuntu 9.10 machine it’s ﻿﻿﻿sun-java6-jdk 6-15-1, on Ubuntu 10.04 (also tested) it’s ﻿6.20dlj-1ubuntu3.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also install the jogl libraries, on this machine called libjogl-java.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure you have the whole of gstreamer installed. On ubuntu, all packages containing “gstreamer”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get and unpack the processing for Linux tarball (I’ve tested this whole procedure with processing 1.0.9, 1.1 and 1.2.1) from the processing <a href="http://processing.org/download/" title="processing download site">download site</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the unpacked processing directory, remove the whole java subdirectory. Now make a symlink pointing to your system java directory (the one containing bin, ext, jre, lib, etc.).  On my system, that was: <pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate" title="">cd processing
rm -rf java
ln -s /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-1.6.0.15﻿ java
</pre></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In processing/libraries/opengl/library remove the 3 libjogl*.so files and libgluegen-rt.so. Symlink their replacements from /usr/lib/jni with for example: <pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate" title="">cd processing/libraries/opengl/library
rm lib*.so
ln -s /usr/lib/jni/libgluegen-rt.so
ln -s /usr/lib/jni/libjogl_awt.so
ln -s /usr/lib/jni/libjogl.so
</pre></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://users.design.ucla.edu/~acolubri/processing/gsvideo/home/" title="GSVideo website">Download</a> and unpack gsvideo into processing/libraries.  You should be able to run the examples in processing/libraries/gsvideo/examples/Capture with the PDE (Processing Development Environment).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://nyatla.jp/nyartoolkit/wiki/index.php?NyAR4psg.en" title="NyARToolkit for Processing website">Download</a> and unpack the NyARToolkit for Processing library into processing/libraries.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You should now be able to run the NyARToolkit examples by changing replacing the import call as follows:</p>
<pre class="brush: java; title: ; notranslate" title="">// replace this call:
// import processing.video.*;
// by this call:
import codeanticode.gsvideo.*;
</pre>
<p>and changing the Capture class (twice) to GSCapture and perhaps also the capture resolution, depending on your camera. The relevant conversions are:</p>
<pre class="brush: java; title: ; notranslate" title="">// Capture cam;
// becomes:
GSCapture cam;

// later, in setup():
// cam=new Capture(this,width,height);
// becomes:
cam=new GSCapture(this,width,height);
</pre>
<p>The major trick in all of this is converting your Processing installation to use your system 64bit JDK instead of its own built-in 32bit JDK.</p>
<p>Let me know in the comments if this worked (or didn’t) for you!</p>
