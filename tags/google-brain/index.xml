What I also found interesting about this work (and related to the above finding), is that they’re able to perform translations between language pairs that the system has never trained on.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>In <a href="https://research.googleblog.com/2016/11/zero-shot-translation-with-googles.html">recent research</a> (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04558">full paper also available</a>), researchers from the Google Brain and Google Translate teams have shown intriguing evidence of a so-called <em>interlingua,</em> that is, a language-agnostic common representation of sentences with the same meaning from different languages.</p>

<p>What I also found interesting about this work (and related to the above finding), is that they’re able to perform translations between language pairs that the system has never trained on.</p>
<p>A further pleasant surprise was seeing how they used the <a href="https://lvdmaaten.github.io/tsne/">t-SNE visualization</a> technique to embed the high-dimensionally represented sentences in 2D, in order to study the interlingua phenomenon.</p>
