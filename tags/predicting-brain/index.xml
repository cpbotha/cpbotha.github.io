<h2 id="merry-christmas">Merry Christmas</h2>
<p>During this week, the most noteworthy happening was of course Christmas.</p>
<p>As a family, we are wholly dedicated to the pursuit and application of Love and
Science. However, we do try to respect the religious customs of our fellow
humans.</p>
<p>In the light of this, respectfully and retrospectively, I wish you all a very
merry christmas!</p>
<p>(I have to say that my kids really adore the gifting-aspect of this
particular celebration, if you get my drift.)</p>
<h2 id="creativity-inc-dot-book-notes-published">Creativity, Inc. book notes published</h2>
<p>I finally got around to processing and publishing <a href="/2020/12/22/book-notes-creativity-inc/">my notes on the book
<em>Creativity, Inc.</em> by Ed Catmull</a>.</p>
<p>There are a number of great nuggets in there if you are at all interested to
learn about the care and feeding of sustainable creative organizations.</p>
<p>Even if that&rsquo;s not your cup of tea, being able to take a look inside a company
like Pixar is quite fascinating.</p>
<p>BTW, books are really cheap upgrades for your brain&rsquo;s operating system.</p>
<p>BTW, I&rsquo;m planning more book notes.</p>
<h2 id="body-budgets">Body Budgets</h2>
<p>On that topic, I have just started reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48930266-seven-and-a-half-lessons-about-the-brain">Seven and a Half Lessons About the
Brain</a> by psychologist and neuro-scientist Lisa Feldman Barrett, after listening
to another <a href="https://lexfridman.com/lisa-feldman-barrett/">super-entertaining podcast with her and Lex Fridman</a>.</p>
<p>I am planning to write much more about her ideas, but for now I would like to
plant this memetic seed:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/23/opinion/brain-neuroscience-stress.html">Our big brains evolved to manage our body budgets</a>.</p>
<p>In short, managing the metabolic needs of a whole human is tremendously
complicated.</p>
<p>Throughout the day (every day), that big super-computer in your head is
calculating a million inputs and outputs to ensure your survival, and more
importantly, the survival of your genetic material.</p>
<p>To me, a truly interesting aspect of this is that social interaction is just
another, albeit important, variable in this complicated system of equations.</p>
<p>One of the implications of this realization is that social interaction requires
a substantial amount of metabolic energy, an equation your brain will apply
quite strictly.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re getting low on energy, your brain could very well cancel that kind
interaction you were planning, instead substituting with a quick eject, because
it predicts (the brain is a fabulous prediction machine, you&rsquo;ll see much more
of that here in the coming months) that you&rsquo;ll probably run out of energy a bit
later.</p>
<p>Related to what <a href="/2020/12/23/weekly-head-voices-212-use-it-or-lose-it/#use-it-or-lose-it">I wrote last week concerning the use-it-or-lose-it principle</a>,
this is yet another reason to invest in one&rsquo;s physiology and its energy
efficiency:</p>
<p><em>Your body needs energy to be nice.</em></p>

<h2 id="on-attempting-to-publish-the-whv-on-a-weekly-basis">On attempting to publish the WHV on a weekly basis.</h2>
<p>Somewhere at the end of the first week, I sat down to write, but I soon
realised that I didn&rsquo;t have all that much to say.</p>
<p>Ironically, earlier that day I had had an online discussion where I made the
statement that I preferred putting out posts regularly, rather than waiting
until until I had something &ldquo;really good&rdquo; to publish.</p>
<p>In the latter case, one tends to let things slip further and further, with that
great internal excuse that one&rsquo;s ideas and writing do not yet satisfy one&rsquo;s
otherwise unspecified but high standards.</p>
<p>In addition, one&rsquo;s performance anxiety is now fueled into a frenzy by the
illusion that surely the expectations of one&rsquo;s audience are growing greater by
the minute, and hence the next post will be measured even more strictly against
the mythical yard stick of blog posts that in reality very few people, mostly
friends, actually take the time to read.</p>
<p>So that happened.</p>
<p>As is the case with many other things in life that seem to follow the Sisyphean
ideal, I have made peace with the fact that I will just continue working at
this, until the end.</p>
<h2 id="a-call-from-the-future">A call from the future.</h2>
<p>I made three longer term technology-themed bets with friends and colleagues at
the IEEE VisWeek conference in 2009.</p>
<p>The idea was that the first of the three would play out and finally be
evaluated at VisWeek 2019 (10 years later), and the other two more or less 20
years later, to be decided at Visweek 2029.</p>
<p>Fortunately I wrote the bets up in a blog post, all the way back in 2009,
titled <a href="/2009/10/18/futuristic-betting-at-visweek-2009/">Futuristic Betting at VisWeek
2009</a>.</p>
<p>To my surprise, but far more to my delight, an overlapping subset of the
involved friends and colleagues recorded an hour-long video message at <a href="http://ieeevis.org/year/2019/welcome">VisWeek
2019 in Vancouver</a> and sent it to me via
the YouTubes.</p>
<p>The main message of their video was that I had lost bet #1, with which I could
agree, and that they had their doubts about my chances in bets #2 and #3, with
which I can not yet agree.</p>
<p>You can read <a href="/2009/10/18/futuristic-betting-at-visweek-2009/#update-on-2019-10-27">the addendum I made to the original blog
post</a> for
all of the details.</p>
<p>When I made those predictions, confident that we would be able to debate and
laugh about them at those future conferences, I ironically had no idea that my
life was going to take the turns that it did, <a href="/2013/03/09/dear-academia-i-hope-we-can-still-be-friends/">out of
academia</a> and
shortly thereafter <a href="/2013/12/14/on-leaving-the-netherlands/">out of Europe</a>.</p>
<p>Fortunately, that futuristic betting blog post seems to have functioned as a
sort of anchor in the sands of time, playing its small part in making the
connection from 2009 to 2019, from Atlantic City to Vancouver and even to
Somerset West.</p>
<p>What will happen in 2029?</p>
<h2 id="humans-predicting-the-world-in-real-time">Humans predicting the world in real-time.</h2>
<p>Based on <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-10/sisd-py101419.php">this recent EEG-based experimental
study</a>, it
sounds like our brains are continuously predicting the next word that someone
we&rsquo;re in conversation with is going to say.</p>
<p>Especially in noisy environments, such as IN DA CLUB, this helps us to
understand what our conversation partners are saying.</p>
<p>What struck me when I read the linked press release, and shortly thereafter
tried to assimilate <a href="https://www.eneuro.org/content/6/5/ENEURO.0128-19.2019">the full
article</a>, quite
attractively titled <em>Neural Signal to Violations of Abstract Rules Using
Speech-Like Stimuli</em>, was that is exactly what computer-based language models
do.</p>
<p><em>Language models</em> are mathematical constructs, which mostly live in software,
that attempt to predict the next word in a sentence, based on the previous
words in a sequence.</p>
<p>Recently, <a href="http://www.fit.vutbr.cz/research/groups/speech/publi/2010/mikolov_interspeech2010_IS100722.pdf">deep learning approaches overtook the more classical statistical
approaches for building such language
models</a>.</p>
<p>Given a few thousand articles in French for example, a neural network can learn
how to predict the next word in any given French sentence with high accuracy.</p>
<p>Together with the fact that the internet is now overflowing with examples of
many human languages, anyone with some spare time and GPU cycles to burn can
train up a language model, or even download a pre-trained example.</p>
<p>Such a language model can then be
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146">fine-tuned</a> for other language tasks such as
sentiment analysis and topic classification.</p>
<p>I enjoyed seeing this (growing) similarity between our built-in language
processing wetware and the rapidly developing world of deep learning.</p>
<p>Maybe you did too.</p>
<p>Just a little bit.</p>
