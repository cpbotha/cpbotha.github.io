<p>Welcome back to the WHV blogging clubhouse, gang!</p>
<p>Somewhat inspired by Descartes, I can say with a fair amount of confidence that
you are now reading these words, and for that I am grateful.</p>
<p>This post covers the weeks from Monday, November 9 to Sunday, November 22 of
the year 2020.</p>
<h2 id="papercite-static-put-some-bibtex-into-your-hugo">papercite_static: put some bibtex into your Hugo</h2>
<p>After languishing for almost a year on my todo list, I finally got around to
cleaning up and making available my Python script for embedding your BiBTeX
bibliographies in your markdown files.</p>
<p>The script is called <a href="https://github.com/cpbotha/papercite%5Fstatic">papercite_static</a>, because it was inspired by <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/papercite/">the papercite
Wordpress plugin</a> that I previously used, but it was built for use in static
websites.</p>
<p>Catchy right?</p>
<p>This is pretty useful when you are academically inclined, or just really like
managing BiBTeX files.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re one of those people, you can go check it out at <a href="https://github.com/cpbotha/papercite%5Fstatic">the papercite_static
github page</a>.</p>
<h2 id="save-image-from-clipboard">save_image_from_clipboard</h2>
<p>From the Department of Catchy Names, the same one that brought you the script
above, comes <a href="https://github.com/cpbotha/save%5Fimage%5Ffrom%5Fclipboard">save_image_from_clipboard</a>!</p>
<p>I wrote this to scratch my own extremely niche itch (scranitch-ware!), but it
could be useful in other slightly less niche contexts.</p>
<p>My Emacs is configured with the org-download package so that I can use any
system tool to screenshot an arbitrary region of my screen to the clipboard,
and then tell Emacs to attach whatever is in the clipboard to the current
Orgmode heading.</p>
<p>This is something I use really often during daily note-taking and task
management.</p>
<p>The org-download package expects a PNG image to be available on the
clipboard. When this is not the case, because the screenshotting or other image
copying workflow instead copied a JPG or a BMP (long story, starts with a W,
ends with SL&hellip;), I get a blank attachment which makes me sad, and costs me
more time.</p>
<p>On macOS, I used <a href="https://github.com/jcsalterego/pngpaste">pngpaste</a> for this, a tool that ensures that whatever image
format is in the clipboard gets converted to PNG.</p>
<p>Well, <a href="https://github.com/cpbotha/save%5Fimage%5Ffrom%5Fclipboard">save_image_from_clipboard</a> does exactly this, and a little more by simply
converting whatever&rsquo;s on the clipboard to the format that you specify.</p>
<p>This has already saved me countless SECONDS of time, and a substantial amount
of frustration.</p>
<p>P.S. I&rsquo;ve again been spending more hobby time with <a href="https://nim-lang.org/">nim</a>, which would have
resulted in a much smaller and faster binary in this case, but the Python
version wrote itself fairly quickly, with both of my hands behind my back.</p>
<p>P.P.S. nim is <em>so</em> hard to resist, in spite of what <a href="/2019/04/15/weekly-head-voices-169-a-cunning-plan/#nimfatuation-is-now-over">I wrote about nimfatuation
being over, back in WHV #169</a>. It combines much of the expressiveness and some
of the batteries-included of Python, paired with the generation of tiny
self-contained binaries.</p>
<h2 id="my-emacs-is-now-all-in-on-ivy">My Emacs is now all-in on Ivy</h2>
<p>As you will <em>most probably</em> remember from <a href="/2019/05/22/weekly-head-voices-171-icemirb/#you-can-easily-dired-jump-to-the-currently-ivy-readd-file-in-emacs">WHV #171</a>, my Emacs configuration used
a mishmash of <a href="https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm">Helm</a> and <a href="https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper">Ivy</a>.</p>
<p>Helm and Ivy are two great, but different, examples of Emacs completion /
selection frameworks, something that is really important to any disciple of
this amazing religion.</p>
<p>In something that is probably some sort of reflection of my character, I was
happily using both of them simultaneously for quite a while.</p>
<p>However, waking up one morning with the realisation that this was yet another
small context switch that was costing me time and focus, in one of my highest
ROI tool workflows to boot, I decided that it was time to excise Helm from my
configuration.</p>
<p>Fast-forward a few hours of Lisp-driven terraforming, and I was all-in on my
Ivy.</p>
<p>During this terraforming I ran into some undesired behaviour in ivy-rich, which
resulted first in me writing <a href="https://vxlabs.com/2020/11/15/fix-ivy-rich-switch-buffer-directories-display-in-emacs/">a blog post documenting the work-around</a>, then
noticing that ivy-rich&rsquo;s astute author had subsequently integrated part of my
fix, and finally authoring a <a href="https://github.com/Yevgnen/ivy-rich/pull/92">github pull request (PR)</a>, merged shortly after to
fix the remaining issues.</p>
<p>P.S. I sometimes wonder whether people outside of the open source world
understand how much github contributed to the software world by streamlining
the process whereby random developers are able to contribute lines of source
code into open source projects like this.</p>
<p>WELL DO YA?!</p>
<h2 id="mynoise-dot-net-is-an-amazing-soundscape-generator">mynoise.net is an amazing soundscape generator</h2>
<p>In the past few weeks, Lazar Focus has rescued my days so often.</p>
<p>What usually happens is that I get distracted&hellip; no wait, I fall down a
rabbit-hole&hellip; no wait, I actually get violently pulled into a rabbit
<strong>singularity</strong> from whence no productivity can escape.</p>
<p>The best I can do at that point, is to pour all will power into my puny arm and
click on that FOCUS button in Lazar Focus, at which point it instantly kills
everything that&rsquo;s sapping my attention, and then I again have a chance to save
the day.</p>
<p>Thanks to a recommendation by Noeska which ended up languishing in my
sub-conscious but then fortunately managed to bubble to the top, I found myself
on a wonderful site called <a href="https://mynoise.net/">myNoise</a>.</p>
<p>This is the creation of <a href="https://stephanepigeon.com/">Dr. Ir. Stéphane Pigeon</a>, a research engineer &amp; sound
designer from Belgium, who has combined noise generation as well as a library
of the highest quality recording of samples from the world over with a system
for composing these into the most amazing sound-scapes.</p>
<p>Why is this interesting, you might ask?</p>
<p>Well, in one&rsquo;s quest to block distractions of all kinds, finding the perfect
aural stimulus that is pleasant, but does not soak up attention itself, and is
also able to mask both external and internal (tinnitus, e.g.) sounds, myNoise
is exactly what the doctor ordered!</p>
<p>To give you a taste of Dr Pigeon&rsquo;s attention to detail, see for example the
<a href="https://mynoise.net/NoiseMachines/singingBowlsDroneGenerator.php">singing bowls generator</a>, and then the <a href="https://mynoise.net/NoiseMachines/enliaVocalSoundscape.php">Free-falling with vocalist Enlia
soundscape</a>.</p>
<p>Notice that in both cases you are able to customise different elements of each
soundscape with the sliders, or even press <code>A</code> to have them animate randomly
over time, morphing the landscape as you work.</p>
<p>What I only recently learned, is that Dr Pigeon designed the soundscapes to
work also simultaneously. In other words, keep the two soundscapes above open
in two browser tabs, and note how wonderfully they mesh.</p>
<p>It really feels like my brain is starting to associate high attention mode with
the mynoise soundscapes.</p>
<p>Between that and LF, we might be going places!</p>
<p>P.S. Narrator: <em>Yes, he did make a small donation to mynoise, and based on the
value he has derived since, will probably make another.</em></p>
<h2 id="what-does-it-mean-for-humanity-when-the-ai-can-derive-your-talking-face-from-your-voice-alone">What does it mean for humanity when the AI can derive your talking face from your voice alone?</h2>
<p>You might have read about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/5/21502003/nvidia-ai-videoconferencing-maxine-platform-face-gaze-alignment-gans-compression-resolution">NVIDIA&rsquo;s new AI-based video conferencing bag of
tricks, called Maxine</a>.</p>
<p>An interesting part of this is that they use a technique, similar to deepfakes,
to send only the pose of your face over the internet, and then reconstruct a
high quality version of it on the other side.</p>
<p>From the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Instead of streaming the entire screen of pixels, the AI software analyzes the
key facial points of each person on a call and then intelligently re-animates
the face in the video on the other side,&rdquo; said the company in a blog
post. &ldquo;This makes it possible to stream video with far less data flowing back
and forth across the internet.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This made me think:</p>
<p>Soon the AI will be good enough that it can reconstruct your face from just the
audio, or maybe even text that you type.</p>
<p>This idea started as a half-serious joke, but it does raise really interesting
questions around the implications of this technology. (BTW, it is technically
entirely possible.)</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re having a conversation with someone, and both of your faces are
indistinguishable <em>simulations</em> of the real thing, and hence help the quality
of the conversation, what does that mean for the conversation that&rsquo;s happening?</p>
<p>In other words, imagine for a second that you&rsquo;re having an intense (emotional)
conversation with someone, but the faces that both of you are seeing, are 100%
synthesised.</p>
<p>They reflect almost exactly how your faces would have looked had you had a
video link, but they are estimated by the AI.</p>
<p>Did you really have that intense conversation?</p>
<h2 id="miniburn-2020">MiniBurn 2020</h2>
<p>As you might remember from <a href="/2020/03/24/weekly-head-voices-191-covid-19-part-1/#sht-gets-real-in-mzansi">WHV #191</a>, AfrikaBurn 2020 was one of the first group
events down here that was cancelled by the pandemic.</p>
<p>Months after that, and with stats looking almost reasonable, the local subset
of our camp (THE BURNIVERSITY) decided to celebrate life together, as
responsibly as possible (which mostly comes down to: stay outside, keep your
distance), by gathering at some secret but beautiful location for the weekend.</p>
<p>(You might have deduced by now that this is one of those Burny situations where
I have no choice but to keep things as vague as they are. I still wanted to
write <strong>something</strong> as a beacon for future me. Future me, when you read this:
Read our private notes man. I left you something there.)</p>
<p>We sort of modeled the weekend like a whole Burn: Friday is arrival, setup, and
first small celebrations. Saturday represents the body of the week: Running,
workshops, celebration. Sunday is, just like it is for the full Burn, the
slightly depressing but already nostalgic clean-up, pack-up and leave the
desert stage. It&rsquo;s surprising how well this whole sequencing worked.</p>
<p>Thanks to the awe-inspiring talents of specific camp members, the cuisine was
divine and the music beautiful. Combined with the personalities and shared
memories of our small ensemble, the resultant experience was nothing short of
magic.</p>
<p>P.S. Ironically, <a href="/2020/11/12/weekly-head-voices-208-blogging-like-its-2009/#thank-you-joris">GU43 <strong>is</strong> turning into the 2020 soundtrack that I wanted</a>.</p>

Two days ago, as I pressed the &amp;ldquo;publish&amp;rdquo; button on WHV #208 (well, it&amp;rsquo;s actually more me doing the t d C-c C-e H H shortcut key sequence in Emacs, but OK), I knew that #209 was going to be a problem.

<p>Two days ago, as I pressed the &ldquo;publish&rdquo; button on WHV #208 (well, it&rsquo;s
actually more me doing the <code>t d C-c C-e H H</code> shortcut key sequence in Emacs,
but OK), I knew that #209 was going to be a problem.</p>
<p>Although the past week, from Monday November 2 to Sunday November 8, certainly
had its share of events quite important to me, none of them are fit for
publication, and none of the concomitant observations can be abstracted
concretely enough (yes, I see what I did there :) to appear here.</p>
<h2 id="searching-for-balance-014-in-2020">Searching for Balance 014 in 2020</h2>
<p>So I considered either postponing a week, or perhaps just mentioning the fact
that Joris Voorn released, on November 6, a brand new album with tracks and
mixes, this time the collection titled <a href="https://www.globalunderground.co.uk/product/gu43-deluxe-edition/">&ldquo;GU43: Joris Voorn, Rotterdam&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>(Thank you <a href="/about/weekly-head-voices-abbreviations/">TPN</a> for again bringing this musical gift under my attention.)</p>
<p>This new release is an important event to me, because I have been wondering for
quite a number of years now if we&rsquo;d ever be graced by a spiritual follow-up to
Voorn&rsquo;s Balance 014.</p>
<p>You see, if my life in 2009 had had a soundtrack, Balance 014 would be it.</p>
<p>It was an important part of the flavour of that whole sweet year, and to a
certain extent also of that of the year after that.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s jump back there for a spell:</p>
<h2 id="my-2009-year-mix">My 2009 year mix</h2>
<p>2009 was the year of my first mini-sabbatical, a <a href="/2009/04/25/my-first-sabbatical/">month-long academic visit to
the University of Magdeburg</a>.</p>
<p>That period in my memory is enveloped in the warm fuzzies, for the largest part
thanks to the lovely people I had the privilege of sharing a bit of life with
there in the spring.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the comparative visualization tool I started working on as main
goal of the sabbatical ever led to anything directly. I do regret that the
abbreviation I came up with, namely &ldquo;CoMedI&rdquo;, for &ldquo;Compare Medical Images&rdquo;, did
not see any further use.</p>
<p>Anyways, I remember a number of multi-hour train trips between Delft,
Magdeburg, Berlin and elsewhere, almost always with Balance 014 on my
headphones.</p>
<p>2009 was also the year of:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/2009/04/04/when-the-going-gets-tough/">me getting on twitter for the first time</a></li>
<li><a href="/2009/05/21/you-must-vaccinate/">my slightly angry pro-vaccination post</a>, mostly because I was quite surprised
(actually a bit shocked) that even people in <em>my</em> circles were doubting
this. If I could only have known&hellip;</li>
<li><a href="/2009/06/14/eurovis-2009/">EuroVis 2009 in Berlin</a></li>
<li><a href="/2009/06/25/bill-buxton-at-cars-2009/">CARS 2009 and Bill Buxton in Berlin</a></li>
<li><a href="/2009/09/05/weekly-head-voices-for-week-36/">friend and TU Delft roomie TNR&rsquo;s PhD defence</a></li>
<li><a href="/2009/09/20/weekly-head-voices-4-the-new-roomie-medvis-at-mevis-fairy-tale-beach/">visit to MeVis in Bremen</a></li>
<li><a href="/2009/10/18/futuristic-betting-at-visweek-2009/">a number of infamous bets made at IEEE VIS in Atlanta</a>. Although I lost the
heads-up display bet (at one point right before Google Glass didn&rsquo;t really
make it, it looked like I could have won) and I&rsquo;m probably going to lose bet
#2 as well, do take note of <a href="/2009/10/18/futuristic-betting-at-visweek-2009/#bet-3-the-future-of-conferences">&ldquo;Bet #3: In 2029, distributed conferences with
tele-presence will be common.&quot;</a>  How things have changed in the past few
months&hellip;</li>
</ul>
<p>I left by far the most relevant year 2009 event for last:</p>
<p><a href="/2009/08/29/starting-today-head-voices-every-week/">2009 was also the birth of the Weekly Head Voices</a>, shortly after the Lowlands
festival of that year, which coincidentally was a positively <em>ridiculous</em>
amount of fun.</p>
<p>So, GU#43 this year leads me, via Balance 014, all the way back to the origin
of the WHV in the year 2009.</p>
<p>Did you notice the number of this edition of the WHV?</p>
<p>Entirely coincidentally, it&rsquo;s 209!</p>
<h3 id="tangent-a-life-without-notes">Tangent: A life without notes</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite shocking how little I have in my notes (or anywhere for that matter)
about that year.</p>
<p>After quite some digging, I finally discovered where I kept my notes then: I
was going through my google docs phase (HEY IT WAS REALLY SHINY!), with bunches
of draft blog posts imported from another much-loved but long-dead google
product called google notebook.</p>
<p>For the past few years now, I have journals of almost every single day, and I
can find any of them pretty quickly.</p>
<p>It feels strange, perhaps even a little scary, trying to page back into 2009,
and finding only a few google docs, backed-up photos from the Nokia E71 I used
then, a few blog posts, and what I could extract from my own imperfect wetware.</p>
<h2 id="thank-you-joris">Thank you Joris</h2>
<p>So, is GU43 the spiritual successor I&rsquo;ve been waiting for?</p>
<p>No dreamy brain, of course it isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>What would that even mean, for a favourite artist&rsquo;s new work to be a spiritual
successor of a particular previous work?</p>
<p>Thanks to my memories of 2009 and its music and its <em>feelings</em> pleasantly
echoing over the years in some subset of the trillions of synapses in my head,
I had imagined that this new work, the successor, might be able to bring those
feelings back to life, magically.</p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>The musical echoes of Balance 014 can certainly be heard in GU43, inevitably
transmitted through the hands of the artist, but this is a new soundtrack
waiting for new adventures.</p>
<p>Memory neurons fire pleasantly, until they are repurposed for new experiences,

<h2 id="intermezzo-for-computer-nerds-wsl2">Intermezzo for computer nerds: WSL2.</h2>
<p>Microsoft released <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2019/11/11/releasing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-19013-into-the-slow-ring/">Windows build 19013 onto the Windows Insider Preview slow
ring</a>, along with the shiny new WSL2.</p>
<p>WSL is a truly interesting development in the evolution of Windows that enables
users to run arbitrary Linux binaries with full Windows integration.</p>
<p>I run a true-blue Linux installation of Emacs on WSL, displaying to X410 on the
Windows side, manipulating files on the native Windows NTFS filesystem.</p>
<p>This is substantially faster for some or other reason than running native
Windows Emacs.</p>
<p>Anyways, WSL2 is the next significant jump for WSL where Microsoft is now
shipping a native Linux kernel together with Windows and exposing this kernel
via a light-weight Hyper-V utility VM with dynamic host memory allocation.</p>
<p>I was planning to wait until it got released on stable, but when MS announced
that it was available on the slow ring of the Windows Insider Previews, the
temptation was too great.</p>
<p><a href="/2019/04/27/new-laptop-2019/">The ThinkPad, my main development machine</a>, is
now running this hopefully relatively safe Windows preview.</p>
<p>At this point, I can report that WSL2&rsquo;s IO on its own local filesystem is
indeed much faster than WSL&rsquo;s. However, IO on the host NTFS filesystem is three
to four times slower&hellip;</p>
<p>This is indeed <em>quite</em> disappointing, as my work use-cases all involve
accessing files on the NTFS side in some or other way.</p>
<p>An unexpected bonus of WSL2 however, is the Docker integration.</p>
<p>Docker for Windows Edge is able to use WSL2 as a backend, meaning much, much
faster starting and general usage of docker containers on Windows.</p>
<p>I really hope that MS is able to improve the 9p-based NTFS IO performance of
WSL2 to at least that of WSL.</p>
<p>Far more unrealistically, I hope that MS finally retires NTFS and replaces it
with something better.</p>
<p>Windows really has been making great strides over the past
years. Unfortunately, NTFS is a gigantic ball and chain that is currently doing
a great job of holding the whole of Windows back.</p>
<h2 id="running">Running.</h2>
<p>At the start of 2019, I wrote that I had an <a href="/2019/01/06/the-2018-to-2019-transition-post/#looking-forward-1">&ldquo;additional concrete (but very
humble) running-related resolution for 2019, but I have decided to keep that
quiet until it’s in the
pocket&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s in the pocket and now I can talk about it.</p>
<p>On Saturday morning I went out for my usual longer weekend run (longer is
anything greater than 10km).</p>
<p>It was cool for this time of the year, and there was almost no
wind.</p>
<p>Importantly, I had had a solid night of sleep.</p>
<p>As I was going out, Morning-Voice whispered in my head: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s highly probably
now, or never again in 2019&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>My longer weekend run proceeded to morph successfully into the casual 20km run
that I had envisioned as my most concrete 2019 running goal.</p>
<p>Achievement unlocked!</p>
<p>Although I had indeed formulated the goal as &ldquo;doing a casual 20km run&rdquo;, the
<em>actual</em> goal was being fit enough to be able to do so more or less on a whim.</p>
<p>For my next trick, I&rsquo;ll try my best not to let it slip back too far.</p>
<p>OH HAI THERE LOOMING HOLIDAY SEASON!</p>
<h2 id="things-are-not-always-what-they-seem">Things are not always what they seem.</h2>
<p>After the morning run, we met with multi-decade close friends for lunch at the
restaurant Gåte at Quoin Rock.</p>
<p>That alternative &ldquo;å&rdquo;, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%85">also known as the
a-ring</a>, should give the first clue that
this place is hipper even than any of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefon">Stefon&rsquo;s
recommendations</a>.</p>
<p>I found the whole experience to be quite magical.</p>
<p>The 25 year old genius chef, Nicole Loubser, together with her team, has
constructed the most amazing culinary experience.</p>
<p>See the airport coffee and cigar below for example:</p>

<p>Our company, together with the beautiful surroundings and the party that had
entered via my mouth into my sensory system, made for a truly sublime
afternoon.</p>
<h2 id="electro-backyard-philosophy">Electro-backyard-philosophy.</h2>
<p>TPN recently and very fortunately pointed out that <a href="https://jorisvoorn.com/">Joris
Voorn</a>, probably my favourite electro artist, has a
new album out.</p>
<p>The album is of course called \\\\.</p>
<p>Below is an excerpt from the lyrics of track 8, <em>This City (feat. Lazarusman)</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are not alone.</p>
<p>When you have yourself.</p>
<p>How can you be alone<br>
How can you be alone when you have yourself?<br>
When you have you?</p>
<p>it is you mastering the art, the tai chi, of you</p>
<p>it is you realising that these fleeting moments are all for you</p>
<p>you have yourself<br>
you are not alone</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To my mind, these words contain echoes of both mindfulness and of
transcendental idealism, all on the background of an über hip electro beat.</p>
<p>At the almost 2 hour mark, these echoes contributed much pleasure to the mental
aspects of my run.</p>
<p>Now when I listen to it in a different state of mind, it is clear that the
music made the impact that it did due to the specific set of circumstances at
that moment.</p>
<p>This is a good demonstration of how dependent an experience can be, and how
fickle and unpredictable one&rsquo;s preferences.</p>
<p>(How do we <em>ever</em> make good choices?)</p>
<p>Whatever the case may be, I have chosen to keep hold of the lessons,
irrespective of the subjective ephemerality of their container.</p>

<p>EAZ has taught me that it would not be the worst idea to limit alcohol consumption slightly more.</p>
<p>As with many other enjoyable things, there is a price to be paid for this enjoyment. If paying that price interferes with the other enjoyable habits in your collection, it makes sense to evaluate and adjust the balance.</p>
<p>That reminds me of one of my favourite electronic music productions of all time: Balance 014 by Joris Voorn. He <a href="https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/5988">blew everyone’s minds</a> when he decided to paint these fantastic soundscapes by mixing together more than 100 tracks, often 5 or 6 at a time.</p>

<p>Right at this point, just after that not-quite non sequitur, I wrote a far too long section on the relative performance of Android and iPhone, with a big “nerd content ahead” warning on it. Fortunately for you, I came to my senses before publishing and copied it out into its own little blog post: <a href="/2017/02/12/android-vs-iphone-performance-a-quick-note/"><em>Android vs iPhone performance: A quick note</em></a>.</p>
<p>Last weekend I dusted off my trusty old <a href="https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html">mu4e</a>, an unbelievably attractive email client, again. This means I’m reading your mail and sending you beautifully UNformatted plain text emails right from my Emacs. As an additional bonus, I put all of the boring details about my configuration into a completely separate blog post, which you don’t have to read, titled: <em><a href="https://vxlabs.com/2017/02/07/mu4e-0-9-18-e-mailing-with-emacs-now-even-better/">mu4e 0.9.18: E-Mailing with Emacs now even better</a></em>.</p>
<p>What I will mention here and not in the other post, is that the current situation is subtly different from my previous adventure with mu4e: Where I previously synchronised all 60 thousand emails to process locally with mu4e, I am now following a more mellowed approach where I’m only synchronising the current year (and perhaps the previous year, still considering) of email. I use the fastmail web-app for searching through longer term storage.</p>
<p>I’m happy to report that so far it’s working out even better than the previous time. I really enjoy converting HTML emails (that’s what everyone sends, thanks GMail!) to well-behaved plain text when I reply.</p>
<p>Finally, after the Nth time that someone shared a clearly bogus science news post on Facebook, instantly bringing my blood to the boil, I decided to write a handy guide titled: <a href="https://cpbotha.net/2017/02/10/critical-thinking-101-three-super-easy-steps-to-spot-poppycock-on-the-internet/">Critical Thinking 101: Three super easy steps to spot poppycock on the internet</a>.</p>
<p>This guide is 100% free, and really easy to send to your friends when you think this is necessary. Please let me know if you have any suggestions for improvement.</p>
<p>Ok kids, that’s it from me for now. I wish you a great week ahead. In the words of Yo-Play: <em>Come on Mitch, don’t give up. Please try again.</em></p>
