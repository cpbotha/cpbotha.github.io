<h2 id="winter-don-t-call-us-we-ll-call-you">Winter, don&rsquo;t call us, we&rsquo;ll call you</h2>
<p>Shortly after the start of this period, June 21 to be exact, I was frankly and
quite pleasantly surprised by the Southern Hemisphere winter solstice.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/sun/south-AFRICA/cape-town">This handy Time and Date website</a> has more details, including but not limited
to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The June solstice (winter solstice) in Cape Town is at 11:13 on Tuesday, 21
June 2022. In terms of daylight, this day is 4 hours, 32 minutes shorter than
the December solstice. In locations south of the equator, the shortest day of
the year is around this date.</p>
<p>The earliest sunset is on 12 June. The latest sunrise is on 29 June or 30 June.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of you <a href="/2021/06/16/weekly-head-voices-226-stress-practice/#solstice-tipping-point-is-coming">might remember</a> that this is an important point in the year for me,
the moment when I can see the big light, namely summer, at the end of the
tunnel.</p>
<h2 id="projections">Projections</h2>
<p>I recently finished reading the book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/55411738-projections"><em>Projections: A Story of Human Emotions</em>
by Karl Deisseroth</a>.</p>
<p>As a layperson, I found this psychiatrist and world-changing scientist&rsquo;s view
of the world, and especially of the psyches of his patients, absolutely
fascinating.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Deisseroth">Deisseroth</a> writes about several different types of psychiatric disorders, but
does so via specific but (probably) fictional patients who embody the important
aspects of the disorder in question.</p>
<p>He also writes about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optogenetics">Optogenetics</a>.</p>
<p>Optogenetics is a technique, invented by Deisseroth, for controlling neurons
with lasers, <em>in vivo</em>.</p>
<p>More specifically, by inserting specific genes from algae, neurons can be
modified to activate when struck by light.</p>
<p>Using this technique, researchers are able to activate very specific subsets of
neurons in mice brains, making the mice feel anxious for example, or
comfortable, or any of the different neural components making up these mental
states.</p>
<p>From the Wikpedia artictle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In systems neuroscience, the ability to control the activity of a genetically
defined set of neurons has been used to understand their contribution to
decision making, learning, fear memory, mating, addiction, feeding, and
locomotion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The use of this technique has already contributed significantly to our
fundamental understanding of the brain, and the first steps have been taken
towards using it in therapy.</p>
<p>Judging by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optogenetics#Awards">the list of awards</a>, the scientific world has really noticed the
value of this work.</p>
<p>Personally, I am optimistic that there&rsquo;s much more to come.</p>
<p>P.S. Close to the end of <a href="https://lexfridman.com/karl-deisseroth/">the Lex Fridman podcast with Deisseroth</a>, Deisseroth
mentioned that he really doubts whether he has done enough&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="batting-for-biyamiti">Batting for Biyamiti</h2>
<p>I am Bat-Fan.</p>
<p>No really, I appreciate bats. (and puns)</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re little flying mammals who see and navigate the world <em>expertly</em> using
echolocation (just imagine what that <em>feels</em> like?!) . They eat large numbers of
insects, including a <a href="https://news.wisc.edu/study-bolsters-bats-reputation-as-mosquito-devourers/">debatable</a> number of mosquitoes (I did not know about the
debate until right now).</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s not to like?</p>
<p>However, during our recent freshly reinstated yearly <a href="/2019/06/30/weekly-head-voices-172-abc/">KNP break</a>, we enjoyed
fantastic summer weather (it&rsquo;s winter down here, but that&rsquo;s Mpumalanga for
you), we spent one night in Biyamiti with a pretty active bat in the room.</p>
<p>As we went to sleep, we thought that it would probably be ok.</p>
<p>It was not.</p>
<p>In addition to the bat expertly dropping something wet in my eye (your guess is
as good as mine), during parts of the night it started doing fly-bys so close
to our faces that we could feel the discrete wind gusts caused by the flapping
of its little wings.</p>
<p>On the one hand I was quite impressed by its sheer <em>mammalian</em> skill, but on
the other we just really wanted to sleep.</p>
<p>We decided that the price of a few extra insects in the room was worth it, and
so we opened the mesh.</p>
<p>Our bat friend, in spite of apparently having built a little nest in the nook
right up in the apex of the roof, fortunately obliged by exiting to perform the
rest of its manouevres outside in the night.</p>

<p>YARRRRGGGHHHH it&rsquo;s now more than a month after the previous WHV saw the light
of day.</p>
<p>This draft, intially intended to see the light of day not much more than a week
after 171, has been languishing in a cold jail of electrons up in the cloud
somewhere for the past weeks, while life was doing its thing, you know,
inexorably marching ahead.</p>
<p>Whatever the case may be, I&rsquo;m happy that we are here now.</p>
<h2 id="the-dark-forest">The Dark Forest.</h2>
<p>I just searched this blog to check: To my surprise, I have somehow not gushed
about the Dark Forest trilogy by Cixin Liu before.</p>
<p>I read Ken Liu&rsquo;s translation of <em>The Three-Body Problem</em> in 2014, and it blew
my mind.</p>
<p>It could be that I deliberately reserved gushing until finishing the rest of
the trilogy.</p>
<p>During the past weeks I finished <em>The Dark Forest</em> and finally <em>Death&rsquo;s End</em>.</p>
<p>This is hardcore science fiction, with enough mind-bending physics ideas to,
well, bend your mind, and an insightful peek into at least one Chinese world
view through the eyes of the author.</p>
<p>Most haunting, however, is this work&rsquo;s dark answer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox">the Fermi
paradox</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-books-will-stop-working">The books will stop working.</h2>
<p>I bought The Dark Forest trilogy as Kindle ebooks from Amazon, adding to quite
a stack of previous Kindle ebook purchases.</p>
<p>As you might have heard, Microsoft are shutting off their DRM servers, and have
<a href="https://boingboing.net/2019/06/28/jun-17-2004.html">warned their customers that &ldquo;The books will stop
working&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>Stéfan <a href="https://mentat.za.net/blog/2016/08/21/amazon-owns-your-ebooks/">has also warned about
this</a> in the
context of Amazon.</p>
<p>Today I saw that Charlie Stross, a super successful author himself, as a rule
<a href="https://twitter.com/cstross/status/1144336012015034368">breaks the DRM on any ebooks that he
buys</a>.</p>
<p>I find all of this a bit chilling.</p>
<h2 id="circadian-brevity">Circadian brevity.</h2>
<p>We have been privy to some of those magical sunny winter days that this part of
the world is renowned for.</p>
<p>However, the days are significantly shorter, and this does tend to have a sort
of narrowing effect on one&rsquo;s days.</p>
<p>More concretely, for these past few weeks (excluding the KNP break mentioned
below) it really felt like each work day consisted exclusively of waking up,
preparing for school and work, leaving for school and work, doing work and/or
school, getting back home for dinner and bath-time, and then going to bed.</p>
<p>Somehow, there&rsquo;s almost no time for anything else.</p>
<p>The optimist in me notes that this is probably really just the shorter days. In
a few months, spring will bring longer days, and longer days have the potential
of bearing much more variety.</p>
<p>The cynic on the other hand is making the scary case that this could just be
one of the many new and irreversible artefacts of inexorably approaching old
age.</p>
<p>Whatever the case may be, the stakes are even higher than normal for
maintaining focus throughout the day.</p>
<h2 id="knp">KNP</h2>
<p>Our (almost) <a href="/tags/knp/">yearly break under the reassuring sun in the Kruger National
Park</a> was just what the doctors ordered to remedy some of all that
darkness.</p>
<p>The sun and the soft winter warmth were amazing as always.</p>
<p>However, I had significant troubles (all of them in my head of course. Wait,
what isn&rsquo;t? HA HA) <a href="/2014/07/16/a-south-african-state-of-mindful/#you-are-turning-into-a-cyborg">disconnecting from
work</a>.</p>
<p>&hellip; only to realise the day <em>after</em> bestie PK&rsquo;s birthday that I&rsquo;d forgotten to
call due to being <em>half</em> disconnected. (Correction: I was reminded by said
bestie. I think in the Book of Etiquette my faux pas is thus at least a -3 on a
scale of 1 to 10.)</p>
<p>Dang it. I&rsquo;m not very good at this.</p>
<p>However, word on the street is that &ldquo;grit&rdquo; is hip again, so I kept at it. (I&rsquo;m
also stubborn.)</p>
<p>By the last day of our break, I think I finally managed to reach the desired
state of disconnectedness.</p>
<p>On this day, we arrived at <a href="http://www.krugerpark.co.za/Kruger_National_Park_Bush_Lodges_&amp;_Camps-travel/shimuwini-camp.html">the Shimuwini
camp</a>,
where a troupe of elephants decided to join us for dinner on the bank of the
Letaba river, about 50 metres from our front porch.</p>
<p>Magical.</p>

<h2 id="solar-powerrrrrrrr">Solar powerrrrrrrr</h2>
<p>Well well well well well.</p>
<p>At one point I was starting to think that it would forever be all talk and no
solar action around here.</p>
<p>However, thanks to <a href="http://redengineering.co.za/">RED Engineering</a>, the
brilliant and well-organized installer (#4 on my list&hellip;) who was also patient
enough to field my never-ending stream of questions, this post and hopefully
many more in the future are 100% solar powered.</p>
<p>(I just checked on the dashboard. Very much overcast today, but plant is
generating enough to power the house.)</p>
<p>When the final bits and bobs have been sorted (most important remaining
challenge is getting the GoodWe GW5048D-ES to successfully talk to the
PylonTech US3000 battery cluster BMS), I&rsquo;ll write a post with more details
about the system and its performance.</p>
<p>Until then, these are the specifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Panels: 18 x <a href="./canadian_solar_cs3u_specs.pdf">Canadian Solar KuMax high efficiency polycrystalline CS3U
355Wp</a></li>
<li>Inverter: <a href="https://www.goodwe.com/Products/index_spec/id/22.html">GoodWe
GW5048D-ES</a></li>
<li>Batteries: 2 x <a href="http://www.pylontech.com.cn/pro_detail.aspx?id=121&amp;cid=23">PylonTech US3000 lithium iron phosphate
batteries</a> for a
total of 7kWh of storage.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="always-be-compounding">Always Be Compounding!</h2>
<p>I think it was during <a href="https://samharris.org/podcasts/155-mental-models/">a recent podcast with Shane
Parrish</a> where I heard about
the idea of applying compounding to aspects of one&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>In short, if <a href="https://fs.blog/2016/03/five-percent-better/">you can become 5% wiser and better every year, you&rsquo;ll be about
twice as wise as you are now in a mere 15
years</a>.</p>
<p>The fundamental principle is one of modest, incremental progress, but, and this
is the secret sauce, <em>consistently</em> applied, without letting up.</p>
<p>If you can write a blog post every week (ahem..) you&rsquo;ll have hundreds of blog
posts in a few years, and something significant to look back on.</p>
<p>(If you&rsquo;re able to write on a specific topic, that&rsquo;s even better. Stéfan
recently Signalled me this very relevant post titled <a href="https://matthewrocklin.com/blog/work/2019/06/25/write-short-blogposts">&ldquo;Write Short
Blogposts&rdquo;</a>.)</p>
<p>If you can write a book chapter every month, you&rsquo;ll have written a book when
the year is over.</p>
<p>If you are able to pick a worthwhile activity or topic, and then to <em>keep on</em>
making incremental contributions to that activity or topic, you&rsquo;ll become
<em>the</em> expert on that topic before you know it.</p>
<p>I think you get the idea.</p>
<p>I find this such a powerful concept, so much so that I&rsquo;ve resolved to integrate
it with my daily checklist.</p>
<p>For me, step one is to have a list of worthwhile directions available, and step
two is to execute, just a little bit, on any of them as regularly as possible.</p>
<h2 id="gou2-tells-it-like-it-is">GOU#2 tells it like it is.</h2>
<p>Recently, GOU#2 (age 9) and her classmates compiled a father&rsquo;s day book, where
each child had to draw a picture illustrating what makes their dad special.</p>
<p>My heart melted when I finally reached her page:</p>

<p>Over here on the tip of the African continent, we migrated temporarily about 1800km to the North-East, to Mpumalanga, where winter is a rather theoretical concept.</p>
<p>The week was amazing.</p>
<p>It’s hard to explain the emotions evoked by the rugged beauty of the surroundings, and by the African sun, albeit slightly gentler than usual, beating down on one’s back.</p>

<p>Added to that, every evening we were embroiled in a non-competitive competition to outcook the previous evening’s culinary adventure.</p>
<p>All of this made for a rather primal holiday experience filled with wild animals, eating, old-fashioned human contact (including a serendipitous meeting with friends I had last seen 20 years ago), thinking and running.</p>
<p>This weekend we’ll hopefully return to the usual WHV programming, with more, you know, content.</p>
<p>Until then, I would like to leave you with the following sunset.

… and this is more or less what it looks like when a cheetah decides to grace you with its presence.

<p>That’s how the African sun sets in Mpumalanga.</p>

<p>… and this is more or less what it looks like when a cheetah decides to grace you with its presence. We had it all to ourselves (this is quite unusual in the <a href="/2014/07/16/a-south-african-state-of-mindful/">Kruger National Park</a> with an animal of this level of celebrity) and were able to follow it until it wandered further away from the road, probably on the lookout for some dinner.</p>
<p>It was a brilliant week-long getaway with the newest little member of the family. The time is just long enough to allow for a complete switch-off (see the “you are turning into a cyborg” section of <a href="/2014/07/16/a-south-african-state-of-mindful/">one of the previous KNP posts</a>) with the balmy weather and the wild animal tracking just adding to the fun.</p>
<p>On the nerd front, I convinced <a href="https://vxlabs.com/">my employer</a> to get me a new Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic desktop. As I spend 8 hours or more monkey-typing on some sort of keyboard every day, having one that works well is quite important. I might have found a new favourite in the Sculpt Ergonomic. It looks like this:</p>








<figure><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ms_sculpt_ergonomic-1.jpg">
    <img
        
            
            src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ms_sculpt_ergonomic-1.jpg"
        /> </a>
</figure>

<p>It’s probably the most strangely shaped keyboard I have ever worked on, but it has grown on me quite quickly. The strange shape helps keep my arms and wrists in an even better posture than with the Comfort Curve 3000 (my previous favourite), and the chiclet keys combine just the right amounts of finger travel economy and tactile feedback in my opinion. My only gripe is that the escape key, which as Emacs user I quite often use, is smaller than the other keys and has a completely different feel.</p>
<p>(An extremely brief final aside on the nerd front: I briefly tried Evernote <em>again</em> as <a href="/2016/01/05/note-taking-strategy-early-2016/">my current note-taking strategy</a> does not support a good web-clipper, and my all-singing all-dancing non-linear knowledge management prototype, now in its seventh complete rewrite, is not ready yet. They’ve updated the Evernote look, but even with 5 or 6 clipped web pages in total in my database, I had trouble getting the android app to sync up with the web version.)</p>
<p>During my compulsive daily RSS feed / twitter / Google+ reading, I came across <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/36/aging/the-wisdom-of-the-aging-brain">this interesting summary of recent research on changes in the aging brain</a>. It’s the type of article that interests one especially when one is in possession of such an aging brain, and perhaps also when it reflects one’s own experiences, all completely hypothetically of course.</p>
<p>In any case, in yet another one of those examples of youth being wasted on the young it’s long been known that <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20227023-000-the-five-ages-of-the-brain-adulthood/">your brain is at its maximum processing capacity and speed during one’s early twenties</a>. In my early twenties, the <em>last</em> thing I was thinking about was my mental performance peaking. It’s a sobering counterpoint that my brain’s processing speed has been steadily declining since my late twenties.</p>
<p>As a sort of a consolation prize, it is starting to look like our brains, when we succeed in keeping them healthy, develop more balanced patterns of activity as we get older. We work smarter rather than harder, unlike those twenty year olds who refuse to get off my lawn.</p>
<p>The article mentions the hypothesis that there might be something that could be called the <em>neuro-circuitry of wisdom</em>, consisting of _the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (responsible for rationality, discipline, and self-preservation), the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (associated with “kind, supportive, social, and emotional behavior needed for survival of species”), the anterior cingulate (which mediates conflicts between parts of the prefrontal cortex), and the striatum with amygdala (part of the reward circuitry) _. With age, brain activity between all of these regions reaches a sort of balance, leading to the owner of said brain demonstrating feats of wisdom which will probably be witnessed by exactly no-one, almost like trees falling in the forest, or almost like the posts on this blog, minus the wisdom.</p>
<p>Here’s to hoping that, as we all near our inevitable final sunsets, we do in fact become ever so slightly wiser, and ever so slightly more capable of contributing peace and kindness to our surroundings; even, or perhaps especially, when no-one is watching.</p>
<p>(I just reminded me of Reggie Watts… see below.)</p>

    Last year <a href="/2014/07/16/a-south-african-state-of-mindful/">I explained about the Kruger National Park, or KNP</a>. Well, we went again this year, and again it was lovely. It helps that in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mpumalanga">Mpumalanga</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limpopo">Limpopo</a> provinces, “winter” at this time of year seems to mean “lovely balmy days with temperatures between 25 and 30 degrees Celsius”. What completely and utterly seals the deal, is being surrounded by this particular permutation of natural vastness. You should go there to see for yourself, but here’s a taste:

<b>EXTREME-NERDERY BULLET:</b> If you’re a Dvorak typist using Java-based tools on the Mac (e.g. Eclipse, IntelliJ, AppCode, and everything by JetBrains) you might have noticed that keyboard shortcuts fall on the spectrum somewhere between extremely wonky and plain <i>infuriating</i>. Besides that you now know that this subset of <i>persons</i> is not limited to just you, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/31119280/532513">here’s an SO answer that I wrote up</a> based on information in the JetBrains bug threads. In short, a long-standing (as in years) bug in Java on Mac means you have to use an open-source tool called <a href="https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/">Karabiner</a> instead of Mac’s built-in Dvorak support.

    A Sunday lunch at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thethirstyscarecrow">the Thirsty Scarecrow</a> led to at least two new discoveries. <a href="https://twitter.com/CitizenBeer">Citizen Beer</a>, a craft beer brewery I have not ran into yet (it’s not for lack of trying, really) makes a pretty delicious amber ale called <i>Alliance</i> (their wonderfully-named <i>Saboteur</i> IPA is not too shabby either):
