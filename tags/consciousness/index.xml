<h2 id="learning-at-the-burning">Learning at the Burning</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s an unwritten rule that you should not make any life decisions for at
least three weeks after the (Afrika)Burn.</p>
<p>Apparently people have, inspired by the sometimes weird experiences of the
event, made some major but unfortunately quite regrettable decisions in its
afterglow.</p>
<p>Anyways, I did not come back with anything like that.</p>
<p>Without sounding (too much) like Zaphod eating the fairy cake powering the
Total Perspective Vortex and walking away pretty much unscathed, through the
week&rsquo;s ups (mostly) and downs I learned a bunch, and I did come back with some
internal changes, but they were at their most extreme a strong reminder (kick
in the butt might even be appropriate) of a partially buried perspective or
two.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is now exactly three weeks after the thing, and although that
dusty afterglow has definitely waned, it feels like I&rsquo;ve just merged back into
reality without any major incidents, just a slight tweak (or gentle kick in the
butt) here and there, for the better.</p>
<p>(Because inquiring minds might want to know, yes, we again brought the
BURNIVERSITY. We&rsquo;re probably one of the smallest theme camps, but we were
intense, and it feels like our interactions were too.)</p>
<p>Anyways, here are some completely random words, some of them loosely based (or
not at all, or something in between) on a recent conversation with friend PK,
and some of them from friend DW:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/2021/07/27/weekly-head-voices-229-staycation-perma-station/#perma-the-five-building-blocks-of-well-being">PERMA</a> is a good framework for your well-being, and that of your loved ones:
<ol>
<li>Positive Emotion</li>
<li>Engagement</li>
<li>Relationships</li>
<li>Meaning</li>
<li>Accomplishment</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>That thing you&rsquo;re stressing about is most probably not worth such a high
personal cost, and health-risk.</li>
<li>Just do the work.</li>
<li><a href="https://typesense.org/blog/the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-just-showing-up-everyday/">Just showing up every day is a super power</a>. Pick your thing(s), show up to
them every single day, profit.</li>
<li>Chopping onions is the physical manifestation of your love for the people for
whom you are cooking. Give it (chopping onions, making food, loving) your
<em>whole</em> attention, and see what happens. Thank you DW, for this wisdom, and
for the food.
<ul>
<li>(Dear reader, between you and me, man that guy was burning so bright&hellip;)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Practice will boost your powers of attention. This will deeply improve you,
and how you interact with others.</li>
<li>Kindness is still the most important super power.</li>
<li>Check up on yourself every day, about all of these completely random words.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="multiplicity-of-you">Multiplicity of you</h2>
<p><a href="/2018/06/10/weekly-head-voices-145-the-narrating-self/#homo-deus">In 2018, I talked about <em>Homo Deus</em></a>, a book by Yuval Harari in which he
discusses several thought-provoking ideas, one of which I highlighted then and
would like to discuss again now:</p>
<p>Your experience of being a single identity, a single <em>I</em>, is most probably an
illusion, as your brain most probably houses more &ldquo;me&quot;s than you would think.</p>
<p>Research by the Nobel prize-winner Daniel Kahneman and his various
collaborators showed that we house at the very least two major selves, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow#Two_selves">namely
the remembering / narrating self and the experiencing self</a>.</p>
<p>The experiencing self is the one who actually does the living and the
<em>experiencing</em> of each moment, while the narrating self is the one who
continuously stitches together your whole story, often bending the truth to fit
its (your) opinions of yourself and those around you.</p>
<p>The narrating self is the one who dominates, for better or for worse.</p>
<p>Kahnemann himself pointed out the irony of this the best:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Odd as it may seem, I am my remembering self, and the experiencing self, who
does my living, is like a stranger to me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(You might have heard of <a href="https://positivepsychology.com/what-is-peak-end-theory/">Peak-End Theory</a>, or the phenomenon that humans tend to
judge an experience based largley on the single peak moment, and on how they
felt at the end. You can thank your remembering self for this, and you can
imagine how this could really complicate your decision making.)</p>
<p>Harari discusses Kahneman&rsquo;s selves, but continues into more research with
people who for various reasons have separated brain hemispheres.</p>
<p>When you show one brain hemisphere one version of reality, and the other
another, it is as if there are multiple narrating selves in the same person who
come up with stories that they are convinced are the truth, although in this
case these stories conflict diametrically with other thanks to the design of
the experiment.</p>
<p>From this and other data, Harari concludes that humans generally house multiple
identities.</p>
<p>What I want to to get at, is that it helps to remember (always) that &ldquo;you&rdquo; are
in fact a collection of sometimes competing &ldquo;you&quot;s.</p>
<p>As if that were not challenging enough, your narrating self takes
responsibility for all of these feelings, and tries to weave it all into a
consistent story, although that is often extremely difficult or even
impossible.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.samharris.org/blog/the-illusion-of-the-self2">an 2012 interview with Sam Harris</a>, Bruce Hood had the following to say about
this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By rejecting the notion of a core self and considering how we are a multitude
of competing urges and impulses, I think it is easier to understand why we
suddenly go off the rails. It explains why we act, often unconsciously, in a
way that is inconsistent with our self image &ndash; or the image of our self as we
believe others see us.</p>
<p>That said, the self illusion is probably an inescapable experience we need for
interacting with others and the world, and indeed we cannot readily abandon or
ignore its influence, but we should be skeptical that each of us is the
coherent, integrated entity we assume we are.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because this thought has become much more prominent for me in quite a positive
way, I would like to take it even further, by reminding you to practise
reminding yourself of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Although your perception is generally tied to your narrating self (the one
that&rsquo;s going to remember this blog post), the complete &ldquo;you&rdquo; in fact
constitutes the whole playing field, the consciousness and its physical
medium, in which <em>all</em> of these selves live and move around. In the words of
Harris, &ldquo;you can drop back into that&rdquo; and just <em>be</em> the consciousness, <em>be</em> that
which contains it all.</li>
<li>While your own selves truly live in this conciousness, high definition
versions of your surroundings and everyone you interact with are also
running in this same (your) neural network.
<ul>
<li>This means that you have a surprising amount of control of how you
experience life.</li>
<li>When you hear a dog barking, this is really nothing more than clusters of
neurons firing in your brain, but you visualize the dog <em>over there</em>. When
you feel the wind blowing over your skin, there&rsquo;s just another set of
neurons firing not far away from the barking dog. It&rsquo;s all inside your
head, and the borders between &ldquo;inside&rdquo; and &ldquo;outside&rdquo; are far more blurry
than you might think.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All of your selves are <em>you</em>. Treat them like you would a group of your closest
friends. You can hold them up to the group&rsquo;s standards, but you have to
forgive, and you have to be kind.</li>
</ul>
<p>Folks, I wish you all (and all the yous), and all of your people, peace and
love.</p>

<p>Since we last connected here, much has transpired, a strangely selected subset
of which is mentioned below:</p>
<h2 id="new-computer">New computer</h2>
<p>An M1 MacBook Air became part of my computing zoo. See <a href="/2021/03/21/new-emacs-capable-hardware-m1-macbook-air/">the new computer post</a> if
you&rsquo;re into that sort of thing. Short version if you&rsquo;re not: It&rsquo;s the best
Emacs-capable device I&rsquo;ve ever used.</p>
<h2 id="pgp-i-m-not-dead-yet">PGP: I&rsquo;m not dead yet!</h2>
<p>In a pleasantly surprising turn of events, I found myself counter-signing PGP
encryption keys with different sets of friends.</p>
<p>In spite of my <a href="/2016/12/11/pgp-never-gonna-give-you-up/">PGP never gonna give you up post</a> of 2016, the thought that
old-fashioned PGP might soon disappear even from my archaic view, to be
replaced by more user-friendly and modern solutions such as <a href="/2016/01/02/when-we-can-lets-use-signal-instead-of-whatsapp/">Signal</a>, has been on
my mind more often recently.</p>
<p>This would not be the worst turn of events. The more people are using secure
and private communication, the better.</p>
<p>However, it <strong>was</strong> fun doing our modest part to bolster the tiny and dwindling
group of humans who know how to use PGP and think that they still should.</p>
<p>All of that being said, we did also make use of the opportunity to perform
defensible <a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007060632-What-is-a-safety-number-and-why-do-I-see-that-it-changed-">Signal safety number verification</a>.</p>
<h2 id="stone-three-healthcare-has-joined-back-up-with-the-rest-of-voltron">Stone Three Healthcare has joined back up with the rest of Voltron</h2>
<p>Back in July of 2019, I <a href="/2019/07/17/weekly-head-voices-173-i-know/#stone-three-healthcare-is-now-a-thing">announced that Stone Three Healthcare had been
officially spun out from Stone Three Venture Technology</a>.</p>
<p>More recently, our corporate mothership embarked on a newly engineered (and
funded) scaling-up journey, bringing with it a host of opportunities for
positive impact on the world.</p>
<p>In the Healthcare company we had to make a choice between sticking it out as a
smaller startup on the one hand, or re-integrating into a newly-designed merged
organization and making use of the extended new capabilities to further our
vision.</p>
<p>(I&rsquo;m really trying to keep it real here, but the line between that and
corp-speak is like mono-filament!)</p>
<p>So, since this past week or so, I&rsquo;m working together with the new merged
entity.</p>
<p>My mandate is now broader in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;ll be focusing on technological solutions for precision Health <strong>and</strong>
Safety, where it was previously healthcare only.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ll be assisting all parts of the company by optimizing technological
processes of all sorts.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is all very exciting to me, and they&rsquo;re even letting me keep some of the
science in my new official title!</p>
<h2 id="the-strange-continuum-of-consciousness">The strange continuum of consciousness</h2>
<p>This is a tricky one to mention, because it probably needs much more space than
I have here, and much more skill than I have to explain.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to try in any case, because just maybe it sparks something for
someone.</p>
<p>A large part of the <a href="https://wakingup.com/">Waking Up meditation</a> daily practice is exploring the exact
nature of one&rsquo;s experienced consciousness.</p>
<p>Specifically, there is the realisation that the whole of your consciousness,
including your thoughts, your interactions with real, live people, and
everything else, takes place in <strong>your</strong> mind.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <em>internal</em> sensations, like an itch, or pain, or a tingling on
your skin, and <em>external</em> sensations, like hearing or sight, although they seem
to be localised <em>inside</em> and <em>outside</em>, take place in the exact same
consciousness.</p>
<p>Everything that you experience, whether &ldquo;real&rdquo;, like looking at the sea, or
imaginary, like thinking about (and hence &ldquo;seeing&rdquo;) something that you need to
take care of tomorrow, or something that you experienced yesterday, are all
simulations that are running as part of your consciousness.</p>
<p>There is a continuum from internal to external, and a continuum from direct
sensory experience to remembered or predicted experience, along with all of its
thoughts and emotions.</p>
<p>These are all the same sort of signals coursing through the same neural
pathways.</p>
<p>Another core idea here is that although your brain is housed in your skull,
your feeling that your consciousness is somehow also localised behind your eyes
is not entirely apt.</p>
<p>Your consciousness is the <em>whole</em> space, with all of your observed reality in
it, <em>including</em> the illusion (or rather simulation) of your localisation.</p>
<p>You (the observer) are not at a single point, but rather everywhere where
consciousness is.</p>
<p>Everything that you perceive to happen, by definition &ldquo;happens&rdquo; in the space
that you call consciousness.</p>
<p>These are tricky lessons to learn, and it seems that at least in my case we are
destined to spend only fleeting moments together, but they have profound and
positive implications for how we go through life.</p>

<ul>
<li>Taking the day off to go run in the mountains: These two separately pleasant
actions are even greater when applied together.</li>
<li>Based on the predictions a week or so before the time, we were going to run
in a bit of rain. As the date came closer, the predicted start time of the
rain kept on creeping later and later. The day itself was mostly gorgeous
sunshine with very little wind.</li>
<li>According to the Cape Nature peeps at the starting point, we were the first
people to run the route since before the lockdown when they, err, locked down
the nature reserve. This was noticeable by the overgrown vegetation we had to
fight through for a kilometre or two, just after the first climb. Other than
that, it felt pretty special!</li>
<li>I like running with a GPX of the route on my Apple Watch (<a href="http://www.workoutdoors.net/">WorkOutDoors</a> is
amazing for following a route with maps while you&rsquo;re running, especially if
you&rsquo;re directionless like me), but I could not find one available online
before the time.
<ul>
<li>So I started a Strava Pro trial so I could use their amazing <a href="https://www.strava.com/heatmap">global heatmap</a>
to draw the crowd-sourced GPX in about 6 clicks. I&rsquo;m probably going to keep
the Strava Pro: Being able to make routes like this of any place that you
might find yourself in is amazing.</li>
<li>You can download a GPX of the route we actually ran, as logged by my
iPhone, by clicking on the following link: <a href="./kogelberg_trail_cpbotha_20201008.zip">Kogelberg Trail GPX</a>. The whole
thing is just under 24km.</li>
</ul>

<p>Below is a video impression somewhere just past halfway. Don&rsquo;t miss the waterfall!</p>

<h2 id="find-a-place-in-the-universe-that-is-your-consciousness">Find a place in the universe that is your consciousness</h2>
<p>On the morning of October 7, about halfway through a 10 minute mindfulness
practice with <a href="https://wakingup.com/">the Waking Up app</a>, Sam Harris says something like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Take a negative emotion, and examine it. Remember, you can find a place in
consciousness that is not implicated, to stand on and be able to do this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His words really struck home at that moment.</p>
<p>By the end of the session, analysing a particular negative thought, I
experienced quite viscerally (haha, sorry) the phenomenon of relatively easily
finding a non-implicated mental space to stand, from where I could take apart
that negative emotion piece by piece, without being drawn into it at all.</p>
<p>Now it feels like all of those practice sessions exploring the <em>experience</em> of
consciousness, as the whole of the reality simulation being run over the
trillions of neural connections in the human brain, were not in vain.</p>
