<li>Unexpectedly enjoyable little run at 7:27 in Land en Zeezicht (Beaumont school district), just after dropping off GOU#3, and just before the dailry heatwave hit. On Reservoir Road, close to the end of my route, I looked up at the beautiful clouds and experienced a feeling of what I can only describe as <a href="/2022/05/23/weekly-head-voices-242-multiplicity-of-me/#multiplicity-of-you">inside-is-outside connected bliss</a>.</li>
<li>Made 40 seconds recording of my talking head in English, translated it to Spanish using <a href="https://www.heygen.com/">HeyGen</a>. I used the resultant video for a short GenAI update at work. Really funny but also a bit scary to see my mouth (in my face) talking Spanish in such convincing fashion.</li>

<li>New licence, requested on Wednesday, delivered into my hands!</li>
<li>Against all the odds, and also in an utterly surprising (to me) move, four of us (3 NL, 1 ZA) have <a href="https://lowlands.nl/">Lowlands 2024</a> tickets. I was not planning to go this year, but friend MG got me back in the programme with a few well-placed Signal messages, casually mentioning that Skrillex was on the line-up (noooooo), and as if that was not enough, Fred Again and Soulwax too (unable&hellip;to&hellip;.resist). The crew will not be as complete as last year, which was why I was planning to sit on the bench this year, but life is short and I miss my friends.
<ul>
<li>I say against all the odds, because <a href="https://festileaks.com/2024/02/lowlands-2024-in-rap-tempo-uitverkocht/">all 60000+ tickets were sold out in 20 minutes</a>. We were in the digital queue together with 130000 other customers (each customer can buy up to 8 tickets!), but we eventually got the message that all tickets had been sold out, indeed after about 20 minutes. We did what many folks apparently do not: We just kept on trying! Looks like the odd ticket, probably from a failed payment, made its way back to the queue, and we managed to buy 1+2+1 by just not giving up.</li>
<li>Now I am equal parts ecstatic and daunted.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sunday-2024-02-04">Sunday 2024-02-04</h2>
<ul>
<li>13km run in the heat. Was planning for shorter, but run was much more fun than I expected, just super hot man.</li>
<li>Through an email from familysearch.org, saw that someone had uploaded scans of the &ldquo;Doop register NG Kerk Worcester&rdquo; all the way outta 1881, through which I could confirm some of my earlier findings (after a long search) re my <a href="https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:6K5Q-5KJ8">great-grandfather Pieter Barend Francois, born in 1881</a>, namely that his dad was Daniël Stephanus Botha born born 1848. Thanks familysearch and thanks Church!
<ul>
<li>You might remember that myheritage was an important part of how I learned that I&rsquo;m actually an Appel straight outta Dutchieland (my home away from home) and not a real Botha. See <a href="/2022/02/03/weekly-head-voices-237-dont-step-over-the-thing/#the-apple-doesn-t-fall-far-from-the-tree">WHV #237</a>.</li>
<li>However, I don&rsquo;t want to renew my myheritage.com sub in February. In spite of their 20% discount offer, it&rsquo;s really quite expensive if it&rsquo;s just hosting my data. It was definitely worth it when I was still actively trying to track down various ancestors.</li>
<li>Now I have to start looking for alternative tools to maintain our family tree. I know about gramps, but tonight I discovered ancestris, which works natively with GEDCOM (not just import and export).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Absolutely sublime dinner outside with my whole family. Infinitely grateful.</li>
