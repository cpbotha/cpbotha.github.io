</li>
<li>On the other hand: Based on the following two recent publications, it really looks like Apple is cooking up something really interesting with large language models (LLMs):
<ul>
<li>Apple announces ProTIP: Progressive Tool Retrieval Improves Planning &ndash; so they are working on much improved ways of hooking up LLMs to tools, perhaps even on their devices? via <a href="https://twitter.com/_akhaliq/status/1736982938942677421">https://twitter.com/_akhaliq/status/1736982938942677421</a></li>
<li>New Arxiv paper by Apple titled &ldquo;LLM in a flash: Efficient Large Language Model Inference with Limited Memory&rdquo; &ndash; from the abstract: &ldquo;These methods collectively enable running models up to twice the size of the available DRAM, with a 4-5x and 20-25x increase in inference speed compared to naive loading approaches in CPU and GPU, respectively.

</li>
<li>Spent some time digging into AppleScript (again) and how I could make a better orgmode to apple notes workflow

<li>Previous attempt is here: <a href="https://vxlabs.com/2018/10/29/importing-orgmode-notes-into-apple-notes/#bonus-round-convert-orgmode-buffer-to-apple-note-using-applescript">https://vxlabs.com/2018/10/29/importing-orgmode-notes-into-apple-notes/#bonus-round-convert-orgmode-buffer-to-apple-note-using-applescript</a></li>
