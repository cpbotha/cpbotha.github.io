<p>I’m still working on my New Year’s resolutions, because I think it’s important to have excuses spend time thinking about one’s ways. There’s something in there about more concrete planning (I’m working on a secret list of milestones for 2011), and also about spending more time each day on the <a href="http://www.pickthebrain.com/blog/important-vs-urgent-5-ways-to-focus-on-what-really-matters/" title="important vs urgent"><em>important</em> tasks as opposed to the <em>urgent</em> tasks</a>. How about you?</p>
<p>May your journey in 2011 be at least as cool as the cyber-suburban odyssey I have planned! To get you in the right frame of mind, here’s a track from the Daft Punk soundtrack of the new <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1104001/" title="IMDB page for the Tron: Legacy movie">Tron: Legacy movie</a>:</p>

<p>P.S. I’m so old, I still vividly remember the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084827/" title="IMDB page of the first tron">first Tron movie</a>. It played a significant role in the shaping of my young character.</p>
<p>P.P.S. I’ve put my beloved E71 in storage and am now the proud owner of a charge-me-3-times-per-day-please <a href="http://www.htc.com/www/product/desirez/overview.html" title="HTC Desire Z product page">HTC Desire Z</a> micro-laptop with built-in phone. I’m going to try and write a post about it soon. Short story: In spite of the battery, I’m in love again.</p>
<p>P.P.P.S. Go and memorise <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_common_misconceptions" title="Wikipedia's list of common misconceptions">Wikipedia’s list of common misconceptions</a>. Go around correcting as many people as you can. Make new friends!</p>
