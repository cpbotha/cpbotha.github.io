<h2 id="running">Running</h2>
<p>My running habit has been steadily returning to its pre-op state, both in terms of
fitness but, more importantly, in terms of joy.</p>
<p>Also, my sixth pair of Altra Escalantes (version 3.0) recently arrived. I
wanted black ones, as I usually recycle old Altras after their recommended
700km or so into super comfortable office shoes, but my supplier was out of
stock and so I ended up with these surprisingly attractive blue and red ones:</p>

<p>In more good news, it turns out that it&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/news/20230719/your-heart-benefits-even-if-you-exercise-as-a-weekend-warrior">entirely OK if you spend all of your
minimum of 2.5 weekly hours of exercise during the weekend</a>.</p>
<p>Personally, I usually manage to fit in two shorter runs during the week, and a
longer run during the weekend, for a desired total of 25km per week, but I have
always wondered if it was in fact required to exercise on every day of the week
for maximal health benefit.</p>
<p>P.S. My main motivation is the unqualified joy of the run and not so much the
health benefits, although the benefits sure are nice!</p>
<p>P.P.S. <a href="/2023/01/01/the-2022-to-2023-transition-post/#running">25km per week was my resolution for 2023</a>, but that plan was quite rudely
torpedoed by my <a href="/2023/07/01/weekly-head-voices-252-prostate-cancer/">prostate cancer adventure a few months ago</a>, so now I just try
to make it week by week.</p>
<h2 id="genai">GenAI</h2>
<p>For the past months, I&rsquo;ve been going deeper and deeper into generative AI, and
more specifically large language models (LLMs), down to the nuts and bolts and
let&rsquo;s-get-Llama-2-70-billion-quantized-and-running-on-my-PC levels.</p>
<p>Here are a few things that I really liked learning about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Although it has indeed been a longer journey, the current GenAI explosion /
hype seems to have been ignited in the third quarter of 2022, with the open
source release of Stable Diffusion in August, and the birth of ChatGPT in
November.</li>
<li>For the largest part, the most powerful LLMs have been trained, on hundreds
of billions to trillions of words, how to predict the next / missing word of
an incomplete document. After enough of this, they appear to gain some sort
of reasoning capability, including being able to answer theory of mind
questions.
<ul>
<li>There are striking similarities to how humans interpret speech.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Almost all of the currently famous models (Stable Diffusion, Whisper, all
current LLMs) are based on a specific type of neural network called a
Transformer, introduced in the paper <em>Attention Is All You Need</em>, published by
Ashish Vaswani and fellow Google researchers in 2017.</li>
</ul>
<p>For many more details about these, and other hopefully interesting
observations, please come to one of my GenAI talks!</p>
<p>GenAI developments are continuing at a truly impressive pace, and now I hope
that we (personally) can also start showing some practical and useful
applications!</p>
<p>P.S. Read the brilliant Lyn Alden&rsquo;s latest newsletter <a href="https://www.lynalden.com/august-2023-newsletter/">Six AI Themes to Consider</a>
in which she discusses how AIs (actually LLMs) are already starting to use
bitcoin (lightning) to pay for services (soon other AIs and also humans) in
order to complete their tasks.</p>
<h2 id="lowlands-2023">Lowlands 2023</h2>
<p>One could say that the WHV series owes its life to a certain 3-day festival in
the Netherlands as <a href="/2009/08/29/starting-today-head-voices-every-week/">it was born in the sweet afterglow of the 2009 edition</a>.</p>
<p>However, due to the strict WHALLSALL privacy policy, you will find only
<a href="/tags/lowlands/">pleasant echoes of the experience</a> in a number of posts on this blog.</p>
<p>This time it felt even more special, because it&rsquo;s the first time that I was
able to go since <a href="/2019/09/01/weekly-head-voices-176-cycle-of-life/">all the way back in 2019</a>.</p>
<p>I was pleasantly shocked by the warm <em>familiarity</em> of my other home, starting all
the way from the airport in Cape Town, joining hundreds of Dutchies returning
home after their vacations in SA, to arriving in NL and letting that lovely
language permeate my neural network, all through the festival chaos and
sometimes extremely close proximity to tens of thousands of locals, to walking
and cycling under the late summer sun, to spending the highest possible quality
time with my friends there.</p>
<p>Again I am left overflowing with gratitude.</p>
<p>Thank you other home, and eternal thank you friends!</p>
<h2 id="i-am-a-function">I am a function</h2>
<p>Back in <a href="/2014/05/07/weekly-head-voices-70-patterns-in-the-sand/">WHV #70 from 2014</a>, based on some reading about the turnover of matter
in humans, I came to the following conclusion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now I see us all as nothing more than the continuously changing patterns that
form briefly in the grains of sand of the universe. Winds blow grains of sand
around, now taking part in one pattern and then in another. At some point, your
body has contained parts of your best friend, and of your worst enemy. The
patterns change continually; sometimes they fade away, and sometimes new
patterns emerge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the intervening years, reader KvG first introduced me to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Watts">Alan Watts</a>, noting
that they saw similar themes in our writing.</p>
<p>I am wording it carefully here, as I obviously can&rsquo;t really compare my backyard
philosophical attempts to the work of Alan Watts, which I have now come to know
better.</p>
<p>That story was required to bring us to this, the concluding quote of this post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are a function of what the whole universe is doing in the same way that a
wave is a function of what the whole ocean is doing. &ndash; Alan Watts</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I really love that.</p>

<h2 id="on-friendship-25-years-later">On friendship, 25 years later.</h2>
<p>The birthday <a href="/2019/09/01/weekly-head-voices-176-cycle-of-life/#celebration">mentioned
previously</a>,
along with the portentous visit of a good friend from afar, led to at least two
small celebrations (that I know of) with a bunch of us that have been friends
for more than 25 years now.</p>
<p>In the bigger scheme of things, it&rsquo;s not <em>that</em> long, but what I would like to
mention here is how much such friendships can grow into the most honest of
human connections.</p>
<p>It is as if with the passing years, one is able to shed all of the unnecessary
baggage one tends to carry around as a beginner human.</p>
<p>What is left, is pure human warmth, unconditional support and, perhaps most
significantly, the effortless loss of self.</p>
<p><em>You</em> fade away, quite happily so, when one of your friends gets up in the
light to tell a story.</p>
<p>For a while at least, one&rsquo;s only representative in the conversation is one&rsquo;s
undivided recognition of and attention to the other.</p>
<p>This is certainly not reserved for 25+ year friendships, although this
pre-requisite seems to facilitate the process to the point of effortlessness.</p>

<h3 id="org-pdf-tools-for-constructing-unifying-notes">org-pdf-tools for constructing unifying notes.</h3>
<p>Recently, I had to work through a stack of regulatory documents in PDF format.</p>
<p>The challenge was that the documents described different aspects of a single,
complicated procedure, but were severely lacking in overview-engendering
outlines or, even better, diagrams.</p>
<p>I did what I mostly do when faced with any research-related complexity: BUST
OUT SOME MORE OF THAT EMACS!</p>
<p>I found the Emacs package
<a href="https://github.com/fuxialexander/org-pdftools/">org-pdftools</a>, which I then
<a href="https://github.com/fuxialexander/org-pdftools/pull/4">PRd to work on my newer
Orgmode</a> (github makes
this sort of collaboration so easy!) and then integrated into my workflow.</p>
<p>org-pdftools enables one to link to specific annotated extracts, created
on-demand inside Emacs, from one&rsquo;s orgmode notes.</p>
<p>I used this to synthesise an overview document explaining the whole process,
linking to different parts of multiple PDFs explaining each aspect in more
detail.</p>
<p>Being able to jump effortlessly from a central overview document to specific
positions in reference PDFs is a huge boon to the research process.</p>
<h3 id="escalante">Escalante!</h3>
<p>One friend of work pointed me at an online source of affordable Altras.</p>
<p>I have secretly been pining for a pair of these shoes.</p>
<p>I was planning to use them for the longer runs when I can feel that my feet
need a little more support than my sandals are able to provide.</p>
<p>However, my feet have really gotten used to the wide open spaces of sandals, or
even better, of going barefoot.</p>
<p>Altras are zero-drop shoes, with <em>ginormous</em> toe boxes. Their motto is &ldquo;Embrace
the Space&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It seems like I have found some shoes with the right motto&hellip;</p>

<p>Friend #1&rsquo;s recommendation had shoes that were semi-affordable, contrary to my
expectation.</p>
<p>When I pointed friend #2 from work at friend #1&rsquo;s recommendation, he pointed me
at an even <em>more</em> affordable source.</p>
<p>I <em>could</em> have continued with this iterative process, but I was unable to delay
this purchase any longer.</p>
<p>My new pair of Altra Escalante 1.0s arrived the next day.</p>
<p>(Yes, I know, 1.5 and 2.0 are available. However, <a href="https://runrepeat.com/altra-escalante">the stellar reviews of
1.0</a> have not changed, and did I say
&ldquo;affordable&rdquo;?!)</p>
<p>On Friday I broke them in, and on Sunday I made a slightly longer than normal
run (see in-progress photo above) to see how they did.</p>
<p>Anyways, in spite of the rest of me taking quite a beating on the second run, I
can happily report that the shoes did a marvellous job of balancing support
on the one hand and foot-freedom on the other.</p>
<h2 id="life-optimisation-tip-73-streak-more">Life optimisation tip #73: Streak more.</h2>
<p>As I was scrolling aimlessly through my facebook feed during my last session
before the Great Social Media Fast of September 2019 (see next section), I
quite ironically ran into a truly interesting post by a Swedish visualization
colleague (SVC).</p>
<p>In this post, he talked about his hobby and progress as a <em>run streaker</em>.</p>
<p>It turns out that there are runners with the <em>excellent</em> additional hobby of
<em>streaking</em>, which in <em>this</em> context refers to the act of running every single
day of their lives, and trying to do these daily runs for the longest
continuous streak possible.</p>
<p>The streakers know of each other, almost like Highlander, and are in a friendly
competition, very much unlike Highlander.</p>
<p>SVC now has a single uninterrupted streak, spanning multiple years, of daily
running behind him. He has friends in his city who have also been streaking for
multiple years now.</p>
<p>I find this fantastic, both specifically as a running and fitness feat, and
more generally as a brilliant human optimisation trick.</p>
<p>The longer your streak, the harder it&rsquo;s going to become to break that
streak. Add in the friendly competition element, and you have become an
accomplishment machine.</p>
<p>I see great potential here in the context of
<a href="/2019/06/30/weekly-head-voices-172-abc/#always-be-compounding">compounding</a>
more consistently, and for longer.</p>
<p>What else could we streak folks?</p>
<h2 id="the-great-social-media-fast-of-2019">The Great Social Media Fast of 2019.</h2>
<p>Twitter, Facebook, Reddit and friends&hellip; hot durnit.</p>
<p>Because I recently re-acquired the habit of checking reddit and twitter
multiple times during the day, I again examined the mechanisms driving this
undesirable behaviour.</p>
<p>The insidiousness, at least for me, lies in the fact that TwiFRaF (twitter,
facebook, reddit and friends) always has something looking like new information
on tap, where with tap, I mean firehose.</p>
<p>At any given moment during the day, when brain desires new input, or is just
tired and would like to take a break, TwiFRaF firehoses are ready to spew
something that appears to be new information but is only a very convincing
analogue.</p>
<p>Brain thinks it&rsquo;s getting what it wanted, plus a tiny and uninspired spurt of
discovery-dopamine here and there, which helps to keep up the illusion.</p>
<p>Any chance of real curiousity taking its natural course is cancelled.</p>
<p>Instead of pondering a question, and then going out on a slow and deliberate
search for information and later enlightenment, the firehose is opened, because
it&rsquo;s easier.</p>
<p>Furthermore, brain is unnecessarily exhausted trawling through a mix of mostly
generic rubbish with, granted, an interesting nugget every blue moon.</p>
<p>Hot durnit.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I like experiments, and Cold Turkey is my middle name!</p>
<p>So, on Saturday I decided to cut out TwiFRaF completely.</p>
<p>Initially I thought it would be an experiment until the end of September, but
now I&rsquo;m thinking that streaking might be an even better option.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see.</p>
