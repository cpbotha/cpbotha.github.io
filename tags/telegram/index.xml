<p>This edition of the weekly (haha) head voices attempts to reflect on the period of time from Monday November 5 to Sunday November 18, 2018.</p>
<p>The following action scene happened exactly halfway through:

<p>Seeing that you’ve made me talk about running again, have a look at this photo of one Luna Mono 2.0 after about 700 km of (mostly road) running in about seven months, and one brand new Luna Mono 2.0:</p>

<p>At around about the same time as the new shoes arrived, shortly after South African customs charged me a painful amount before letting the new babies through, both my ankles, from around the posterior tibial tendon area, let me know in no uncertain terms that they were now <em>demanding</em> a break.</p>
<p>After repeated explanations by my life partner (she counts being a rheumatologist amongst her many talents), and by a foot surgeon friend, that my flat feet mean that my posterior tibial tendons have to work even harder than they would usually have done had I been anatomically speaking more normal, I had to start facing the music:</p>
<p><em>I was going to have to wear normal person running shoes again.</em></p>
<p>(If I have to be honest I would have to say that the music was in fact more about having to take a running break. I had sneakily been pushing up my weekly distance, trying to run through ankle discomfort, and this was probably the true core of the problem.</p>
<p>All of that being said, I am choosing to interpret matters a bit differently. Running breaks are really hard yo.)</p>
<p>I’ve now done two runs in my pre-Mono Kinvara 8s, and it does indeed feel (of course it does) like my ankles might slowly be recovering. I am hopeful that the trend continues, and that I can eventually rotate in my Lunas again.</p>
<h1 id="nerd-toys-update-rtx-2070-in-da-house">Nerd toys update: RTX 2070 in da house.</h1>
<p>After weeks of deliberating, I broke down and bought an <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/rtx-2070/">NVIDIA RTX 2070</a> for deep learning.</p>
<p>This in turn led to a flurry of experimentation and to be quite honest a slight case of deep learning binging.</p>
<p>At least I have the following new blog posts to show for it:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://vxlabs.com/2018/11/04/pytorch-1-0-preview-nov-4-2018-packages-with-full-cuda-10-support-for-your-ubuntu-18-04-x86_64-systems/">PyTorch 1.0 preview (Nov 10, 2018) packages with full CUDA 10 support for your Ubuntu 18.04 x86_64 systems</a> – In order to use the shiny new TensorCores on the RTX for more efficient deep learning, you need a CUDA 10 build of PyTorch. YOUR WISH IS MY COMMAND.</li>
<li><a href="https://vxlabs.com/2018/11/19/configuring-emacs-lsp-mode-and-microsofts-visual-studio-code-python-language-server/">Configuring Emacs, lsp-mode and Microsoft’s Visual Studio Code Python language server</a> – When you prefer using Emacs inside of a tmux in a mosh or ssh session to your Linux desktop with the RTX 2070 to develop PyTorch and fastai scripts (no Jupyter in sight, what a relief!), you need the best code-intelligence you can get. Visual Studio Code’s Python Language Server McGuyvered right into Emacs will do nicely thanks!</li>
<li><a href="https://vxlabs.com/2018/11/21/a-simple-ansible-script-to-convert-a-clean-ubuntu-18-04-to-a-cuda-10-pytorch-1-0rc-fastai-miniconda3-deep-learning-machine/">A Simple Ansible script to convert a clean Ubuntu 18.04 to a CUDA 10, PyTorch 1.0rc, fastai, miniconda3 deep learning machine</a> – When you need MOAR firepower to train your networks with larger batch sizes, or just to see how much memory your network would have taken in fp32 mode instead of mixed-precision, this ansible script will reproducibly convert a clean Ubuntu 18.04 GPU instance, such as that supplied by PaperSpace or Google Compute Engine, into a CUDA 10, PyTorch, fastai, miniconda3 deep learning playground, all in about 10 minutes.</li>
</ul>
<p>(I know that some of these occurred outside of the two week timespan covered by this post.)</p>
<h2 id="on-the-memory-saving-of-mixed-precision-training">On the memory saving of mixed-precision training.</h2>
<p>In my tests with ResNet50, a serious convolutional neural network for image classification, the exact same network with the exact same training settings required 14159 MiB in fp32 mode but only 7641 MiB in mixed precision mode.</p>
<p>This means that in some cases, this new RTX 2070 can go toe-to-toe with many far more expensive cards.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I informally measured a training speed boost of about 20% with the smaller ResNet34.</p>
<p>It’s no wonder that the <a href="http://timdettmers.com/2018/11/05/which-gpu-for-deep-learning/">RTX 2070 gets the Tim Dettmers stamp of approval for the most cost-effective training</a>.</p>
<h1 id="your-message-to-take-home">Your message, to take home.</h1>
<p>I came across this backyard philosophy jewel <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/9ozu4e/til_in_test_screenings_willy_wonka_had_a_scene/">on reddit the other day</a> and loved it. It’s about the 1971 movie W_illy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory_, a stellar adaptation of Roald Dahl’s book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_and_the_Chocolate_Factory">Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… in test screenings, Willy Wonka had a scene with a hiker seeking a guru, asking him the meaning of life. The guru requests a Wonka Bar. Finding no golden ticket, he says, “Life is a disappointment.” The director loved it, but few laughed. A psychologist told him that the message was too real.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just remember the <a href="/2018/06/03/weekly-head-voices-144-eternal-learner/#the-buddhist-twist">Buddhist Twist</a> my friends:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… and finally passing through the gate of wishlessness (apranihita) – realizing that nirvana is the state of not even wishing for nirvana.</p>

In the hardly started tradition of writing blog posts in music-backed focus blocks, I have my “upbeat thinking” playlist teed up and ready to go. The outline of this post formed itself as a Real Bullet List(tm) in my Emacs about an hour ago.
Let’s go.

<p>We’re getting back on track with the WHVs friends!</p>
<p>In the hardly started tradition of <a href="/2018/01/07/weekly-head-voices-126-fleur-de-lis/">writing blog posts in music-backed focus blocks</a>, I have my “upbeat thinking” playlist teed up and ready to go. The outline of this post formed itself as a Real Bullet List(tm) in my Emacs about an hour ago.</p>
<p>Let’s go.</p>
<h1 id="they-grow-up-so-fast">They grow up so fast</h1>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind">Theory of Mind, or ToM</a>, is an important mental capability that we use to model and predict the thoughts and desires of fellow humans.</p>
<p>Just the other day, as we were going through our school morning ritual of the offspring units eating breakfast together and the adults self-administering the correct number of espressos required for normal functioning, GOU#3 calmly informed me from her mother’s lap:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Daddy, mommy would like another biscuit with her coffee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Genetic Offspring Unit #3 only very recently turned 2.</p>
<p>With this request, she demonstrated surprising levels of ToM and planning ability. She inferred, entirely correctly,  what her parental unit required at that moment, and performed exactly the correct action (delegation, yikes!) to satisfy that requirement.</p>
<p>I am still suitably impressed.</p>
<h1 id="sketchnote-your-life">Sketchnote your life</h1>
<p><a href="http://rohdesign.com/sketchnotes/">Sketchotes</a> refer to a type of hand-written notes that employs both writing and drawing techniques. Here’s an example by Emacs guru and famous internet person <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/">Sacha Chua</a>:</p>

        /> </a>

<p>I’m trying to spend more time dedicated to thinking and so-called conceptualising. Sketchnotes seems like a good tool to use during these thinking sessions, so last week this formed the ideal excuse to go out and acquire a new large Moleskine with blank pages (I used to use Moleskines for all my note-taking before going digital), and a whole bunch of sketchnote-recommended pens (Pilot Hi-TecPoint 0.5 which I already had one of; Pilot G-TEC-C4 for super fine drawing, pen also turned out to have best handling of the lot despite its simplicity; Pentel Energel 0.7mm).</p>
<p>My first session was spent sketching out my current life landscape (thank you KvG for this tip years ago), including work, side-projects and a bunch of developing and potential opportunities, as well as the links between them.</p>
<p>I can report that drawing like this is a great trick to keep one’s attention glued to the page, and hence to the chosen focus, whilst at the same time maintaining sufficient mental distance to process the more substantial  thoughts and all of their interactions.</p>
<h1 id="telegram-has-the-public-group-chat-market-cornered">Telegram has the public group chat market cornered</h1>
<p>For private messaging, I have a <a href="/2016/01/02/when-we-can-lets-use-signal-instead-of-whatsapp/">strong preference for Signal</a>, especially over WhatsApp.</p>
<p>Besides the dubious future of WhatsApp’s privacy (Founder #1 Jan Koum is planning to leave while Founder #2 Brian Acton recently donated 50 million dollars to Signal), the WhatsApp web-app is more irritation than it’s worth. The fact that I have to keep my phone awake and connected to the network is a silly constraint which even the far more secure Signal desktop app does not require.</p>
<p>Anyways, I digress.</p>
<p>This section is about <a href="https://telegram.org/">Telegram</a>, another messaging app with dubious security that at least does not belong to Facebook.</p>
<p>Besides all of its stickers, animated gifs, and (non-)useful bots everywhere, Telegram has two additional features which are quiet compelling:</p>
<p>Although it requires a telephone number to be setup, you can configure a username which you can give out to people instead of your telephone number to have them contact you. This adds an extra layer of privacy which is sometimes useful.</p>
<p>More interestingly, Telegram has the concept of “supergroups”. These are public groups which can be joined by anyone if they have the name, and <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/admin-revolution">support up to 10000 (yes ten thousand) users</a>.</p>
<p>This is ideal for easily starting special interest groups, and can be seen as a modern and mobile-first form of IRC. The mobile apps are generally really fast and full featured.</p>
<p>Anyways, on a lark we created one such group, called <a href="https://t.me/zatechlight">ZA Tech Light</a>, for tech people (aka nerds) in ZA. If you are such a person, or you just like chatting with nerds in ZA, feel free to <a href="https://t.me/zatechlight">drop in at @zatechlight</a>. Although primarily lark-based, this could be seen as a sort of splinter group of the much larger (because older) Slack group called <a href="https://zatech.slack.com/">ZA Tech</a>.</p>
<h1 id="running-update">Running update</h1>
<p>Yesterday, I did my second 10km+ run in the <a href="https://cpbotha.net/2018/04/08/weekly-head-voices-139-luna/">Lunas</a>, bringing total sandal running distance to 107km.</p>
<p>I am now back up to my pre-sandal standard running route distance.</p>
<p>That being said, my calf muscles are still complaining quite loudly after every run. The recovery perioud seems to be shortening however, and the calf muscle complaints are less convincing every time.</p>
<p>All of THAT being said, running barefoot- aka primitive-style feels amazing, so much so that although one does keep an eye on things, one does not perceive the above-mentioned muscle discomfort as an issue at all.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the patella strap I previously had to wear during running, to prevent knee pain, has been lying in my cupboard, unused for the past 107km.</p>
<h1 id="the-side-project-dilemma">The side-project dilemma</h1>
<p>Most nerds I know have side-projects.</p>
<p>It’s how we learn new things and keep ourselves constructively entertained.</p>
<p>Up to now, I’ve usually chosen my side-projects not only on the basis of learning, but also based on their business potential. Some of them have indirectly led to revenue, partially through the business-relevance check, but so far never directly. That is, I’ve never brought a side-project to market.</p>
<p>This weekend I had an idea for a pretty obscure side-project. In terms of creativity and learning, and of passion and brain-fit, it scores highly, but in terms of direct business potential quite the opposite.</p>
<p>I’m probably at least going to start, because it’s too much fun not to.</p>
<p>What is your approach in situations like this? Do side-projects have to satisfy any kind of utility requirement? Which criteria do you use to select your next side-project?</p>
<h1 id="bhayi-bhayi">Bhayi bhayi</h1>
<p>Thanks for reading this far peeps! I hope you have a beautiful week, and that we might meet again at the end.</p>

<p>The whole world is using WhatsApp to message each other. I often do too,
because I want to inter-operate with the rest of the world.</p>
<p>However, WhatsApp belongs to Facebook.</p>
<p>Although Facebook <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/24/zuckerberg-facebook-whatsapp_n_4848205.html">has promised otherwise</a> (fast-forward a few years: Yes,
they did break that promise. See updates at the end of this post.), the
temptation to link all of your WhatsApp messages with Facebook logins (a
straight-forward process, as they have the mobile phone numbers of a great
number of their users) must be <strong>quite</strong> tempting to the people at
Facebook. Imagine how well they would then be able to target their advertising,
based on their access to both your Facebook profile and your private WhatsApp
messages!</p>
<p>Fortunately, we now have an open source app, called <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> (available on
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms&amp;hl=en">Android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/za/app/signal-private-messenger/id874139669?mt=8">IOS</a> and the desktop), which performs end-to-end encryption
on all messages and voice calls that go through it. This means that absolutely
no-one is able to read your messages or eavesdrop on your voice calls, except
the intended recipients.</p>
<p>My request is that you get your contacts to install and <a href="https://theintercept.com/2015/03/02/signal-iphones-encrypted-messaging-app-now-supports-text/">start using Signal</a>
instead of WhatsApp wherever possible. At the very least some of our messages
will not be accessible to various large corporations and any other prying
eyes. If the security argument is not enough for you, there is one more
extremely important topic: Signal handles animated gifs better than WhatsApp,
at least on Android. (Telegram supports them on both Android on IOS, but it is
by default less secure than Signal). See here the results of my experiments:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Animated GIF support (most important feature in any messaging app): WhatsApp fail, Viber fail, Telegram pass, Signal pass on Android.</p>— Charl Botha 😷 #Masks4All (@cvoxel) <a href="https://twitter.com/cvoxel/status/682942239463587841?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 1, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
<h1 id="updates">Updates</h1>
<h2 id="january-8-2021">January 8, 2021</h2>
<p>By now, if you use WhatsApp, the app will have forced you to accept the new
privacy and data sharing agreement.</p>
<p>As is explained in this <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/01/whatsapp-users-must-share-their-data-with-facebook-or-stop-using-the-app/">post on
arstechnica</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Under the new terms, Facebook reserves the right to share collected data with its family of companies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, even more of the personal data of 2 billion or so WhatsApp
users will be integrated with everything Facebook knows about them and about
you, including all of your connections to each other on all of the facebook
platforms, including facebook itself, instagram and whatsapp.</p>
<p>Like many of you, to interoperate with the world I do need to keep WhatsApp,
but I would greatly prefer chatting with you on Signal.</p>
<h2 id="august-25-2016">August 25, 2016</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/8/25/12638698/whatsapp-to-start-sharing-user-data-with-facebook">The Verge reported that WhatsApp will now officially begin sharing data with
Facebook</a>. They will indeed link up telephone numbers and social networks,
meaning that both parties will get a tremendous boost in what they know about
you. I don&rsquo;t want to say I told you so, but I told you so. ;)</p>
