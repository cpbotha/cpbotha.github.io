However, here I am to bring you a super-duper compact time-saving edition of the Weekly Head Voices, filled with the highlights of week 12 of 2011. I’ll start this edition with some church:

<li>I’ve tried to give you a more snappy blog loading experience by installing the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-super-cache/" title="wp super cache page">WP Super Cache</a> (with a 24 hour site preload), <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/db-cache-reloaded-fix/" title="db cache reloaded fix page">DB Cache Reloaded Fix</a> and <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/use-google-libraries/" title="use google libraries plugin">Use Google Libraries</a> plugins. In many cases, you’ll get served a static HTML page, which is much faster than the on-demand SQL-spewing PHP-generated complexity WordPress usually does. In the great big quagmire that is WordPress caching plugins, this combination seems to be working best in my case. Measuring with <a href="http://tools.pingdom.com/" title="tools.pingdom.com site speed measurement">tools.pingdom.org</a> (awesome resource!), most of the pages on this site should now fully render in around 2 seconds.</li>
<li>The <a href="/about/weekly-head-voices-abbreviations/" title="WHV abbreviations page, so you can figure out who's who">TNR</a> and I souped up the <a href="http://graphics.tudelft.nl/" title="work website: TU Delft Graphics group">work website</a>, it’s looking really spiffy now, with embedded RSS feeds and all!</li>
<li>I’ve finally installed <a href="http://latedroid.com/juicedefender" title="JuiceDefender website">JuiceDefender</a> on my <a href="http://vxlabs.com/2011/01/22/htc-desire-z-an-in-depth-and-nerdy-review/" title="review of my telephone">laptop with built-in telephone</a> (my HTC Desire Z smartphone, in other words), the battery almost lasts the whole day now! If you have an Android telephone and your not happy with your battery life (err, is that even a question?), get this app. Now.</li>
<li>I opposed an M.Sc. defence on Tuesday on the ultrasound measurement of tendon displacement <em>in vivo</em> and subsequent derivation of moment arms. Great fun diving into new work like that! The student did a great job.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.simvis.at/" title="our man in vienna's headquarters">Our Man in Vienna</a> came to visit us in Delft. Huge fun was had by me and Our Man in Vienna (I hope), and serious work was done. It’s a great combination, we will attempt to apply it more often.</li>
<li>On Friday evening I slipped and did our <a href="http://belastingdienst.nl/" title="belastingdienst site">yearly tax return</a> by accident. BAM!</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the end my friend. Here’s some more church (a different one, at least), taken after a scrumptious dinner in the city:
