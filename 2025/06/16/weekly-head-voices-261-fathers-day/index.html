The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes, but in having new eyes.

It&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s day today.
When I woke up and went to say good morning to Genetic Offspring Unit (GOU) #3, she gave me the card she made, with a rainbow and a red heart and a sweet hand-written message in 9-year-old Afrikaans."><meta property="og:type" content="website"><meta property="og:locale" content="en_US"><meta property="og:url" content="https://cpbotha.net/2025/06/16/weekly-head-voices-261-fathers-day/"><meta property="og:image" content="https://cpbotha.net/2025/06/16/weekly-head-voices-261-fathers-day/20250428_clarence_pano_hu_bdfc48c092e2df2.webp"><link rel="shortcut icon" href=/favicon.ico><link href=https://cpbotha.net/webfonts/ptserif/main.css rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link href=https://cpbotha.net/webfonts/source-code-pro/main.css rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Newsreader:ital,wght@0,400;0,700;1,400;1,700&family=Roboto:ital,wght@0,400;0,700;1,400;1,700&display=swap"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cpbotha.net/css/style.css><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.153.2"></head><body><div id=container><header id=header><div id=header-outer class=outer><div id=header-inner class=inner><a id=main-nav-toggle class=nav-icon href=javascript:;></a><a id=logo class=logo-text href=https://cpbotha.net/>voices in my head</a><nav id=main-nav><a class=main-nav-link href=/about/>About</a>

(GOU #2 has found her passion in drawing. She practises on most days, and her skill and talent are very obvious.)</p><p>Soon after, GOU #1 arrived home with flat whites (my favourite), fresh ciabatta and croissants from the bakery, and hugs.</p><p>What I&rsquo;m trying to say here is that when your offspring units all tell you in their different ways that they appreciate you being their dad, when you&rsquo;re fundamentally dedicated to and deeply grateful for being just that, and those very offspring units constitute the whole focus of this important life endeavour, you better hope that you are able to keep those eyes dry.</p><h2 id=vo-max-redux>VO₂ Max redux</h2><p>One of my <a href=/2024/01/04/the-2023-to-2024-transition-post/#running-and-exercise>exercise goals for 2024</a> was to reach a VO₂ Max of at least (HAHAHA) 50.</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t make it in 2024, but I also didn&rsquo;t do anything other than just my normal running during the year. I know that I should probably engage in some high intensity interval training of some sort if I really want to move the needle, but I run because I like running and not because I want to be fit, although I do want to be fit. (It&rsquo;s complicated being a teenager.)</p><p>At the start of 2025, I stated, much more softly this time, that I would maybe <a href=/2025/01/19/the-2024-to-2025-transition-post/#running-and-exercise>still like to hit that 50 VO₂ Max</a>.</p><p>Again I realized I would have probably have to <em>do</em> something interval-ly about it, but again I kept on postponing.</p><p>WELL KIDS it turns out that postponing can also be a winning strategy! On Monday, May 19, my Garmin reported that I had indeed hit a VO₂ Max of 50, which, <a href=https://www8.garmin.com/manuals/webhelp/GUID-C001C335-A8EC-4A41-AB0E-BAC434259F92/EN-US/GUID-1FBCCD9E-19E1-4E4C-BD60-1793B5B97EB3.html>according to its tables</a>, places me at the bottom of the coveted top-most category for my age and gender, namely <em>Superior</em>.</p><p>I always knew it, but thanks anyways Garmin!</p><p>P.S. I do have to deflate my <em>superiority</em> a bit by reminding us all that, in addition to finding myself at the bottom of the superior range, I have also only recently entered my current age section, giving me an extra advantage. Jokes aside, 50 at 50 is not bad, so allow me to bask for a while.</p><h2 id=org-mode-timestamps-in-obsidian>org-mode timestamps in obsidian</h2><p>One feature I have really been missing in Obsidian since <a href=/2025/03/11/weekly-head-voices-259-backbone/#a-bient%C3%B4t-monsieur-org>my recent break-up with Org-mode</a> is the amazing org timestamps.</p><p>There is no real convention in Obsidian, whilst in Org-mode timestamps <a href=https://orgmode.org/manual/Timestamps.html>are well-defined and quite functional</a>. My &ldquo;old&rdquo; notes are scattered with them: time ranges, scheduled times, deadlines, random timestamps inside random text notes.</p><p>The time logging script <a href=/2025/04/22/weekly-head-voices-260-not-your-guy-buddy/#loggin-time>I mentioned previously</a> made use of the dataview-convention of adding timestamps to work items for example:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=background-color:#f7f7f7;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-markdown data-lang=markdown><span style=display:flex><span>## theme 1

Speaking of which, full org timestamps can have <code>[[...]]</code> links around the date parts so that they link back to the relevant daily file.</p><figure><a href=obsidian-org-timestamps.webp><img sizes="(min-width: 35em) 1200px, 100vw" srcset='https://cpbotha.net/2025/06/16/weekly-head-voices-261-fathers-day/obsidian-org-timestamps_hu_e1ef46eb4edabd57.webp 480w,

Although I still feel strongly about writing each of these words by myself, the experience of the resultant output happens on the background of machines that can now generate hundreds of perfectly-written versions of this post in an instant.</p><p>Anyways, I plan to continue with this labour of love, even as it becomes increasingly difficult.</p><p>P.S. My recent reading / book-listening has taken me on fascinating journeys through neuroscience and consciousness.
