in 2017 with a giant bottle of helium, a bag of CR2032 button cell batteries and leds, and another bag full of
helium-grade balloons. (In short: On the less windy nights, we would inflate clusters of 4 to 5 balloons with helium,
each with a burning led inside, and attach the cluster to a theme camp member. Picture little clouds of illuminated
helium balloons floating above their humans as they were roaming over the Binnekring.)</p></p><p class=article-more-link><a href=/2024/08/10/afrikaburn-2018-hivemind-proximity/>Read More</a></p></div><footer class=article-footer><ul class=article-tag-list><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net/tags/afrikaburn>afrikaburn</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net/tags/arduino>arduino</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net/tags/c++>c++</a></li></ul></footer></div></article><article class="article article-type-post" itemscope itemprop=blogPost><div class=article-inner><header class=article-header><h1 itemprop=name><a class=article-title href=/2024/03/31/weekly-head-voices-254-ratio/>Weekly Head Voices #254: Ratio</a></h1></header><div class=article-meta><a href=/2024/03/31/weekly-head-voices-254-ratio/ class=article-date><time datetime=2024-03-31T15:02:00.000+02:00 itemprop=datePublished>2024-03-31</time></a><div class=post-categories><div class=article-category><a class=article-category-link href=https://cpbotha.net//categories/weekly-head-voices>weekly head voices</a></div></div></div><div class=article-entry itemprop=articleBody><p><p>Hello there WHV enjoyers, and welcome back!

Will have to upgrade our private internal assistant, code name StoneGPT.</li><li>Inspired by stefanv, carefully trying out weekly planning, but in a slight deviation I&rsquo;m doing this <em>in addition</em> to my daily planning, which I only get around to a fraction of the time in any case. I think that this sort of multi-scalar examination and planning will help.</li><li>Went to Bloemhof for the welcoming of the new grade 8 learners.

Slowly starting to use <a href=https://ialab.it.monash.edu/webcola/>webcola</a> again, but this time with d3@latest &ndash; sorta works, but no dragging.

My hip sent me a Teams message &ldquo;Hi&mldr;&rdquo; at about 80% of the route somewhere, but fortunately no follow-up.
