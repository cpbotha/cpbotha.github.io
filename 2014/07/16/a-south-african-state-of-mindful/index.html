Instead I’ll be writing about my vacation, with pictures, and a little bit of backyard philosophy.</p><p>This post is being written in a speeding Toyota Quantum 10-seater minibus (yes, it looks exactly like a taxi, we are currently the king of the road). Don’t worry, my co-driver has taken over. I’m not yet ready to attempt blogging whilst driving. (I do aspire.)</p><p>In any case, the week started with us flying from Cape Town to Johannesburg, and then making our way in this same speeding minibus to the Skukuza gate of the <a href=http://www.sanparks.co.za/parks/kruger/>Kruger National Park</a>, henceforth KNP. (This park is about 19500 square kilometres, almost half the size of The Netherlands!)</p><p>Due to a wrong turn-off (we blame the GPS), we spent an hour or two navigating pothole-riddled roads in pitch dark conditions in perhaps not the safest regions of my beloved country. It was one of those stressful but life-affirming experiences for which one is thankful but would prefer never having to repeat.</p><p>We spent the rest of the week more or less in the wild, mostly at a game lodge directly adjacent to the KNP. It’s quite amazing what being surrounded by the bush and all kinds of wild animals does to one’s state of mind. One by one, all of the incoming streams of information and internal lines of busy-thought are put firmly in their place, in some cases switched off with resounding clicks, eventually turning really-really-busy-you into mindful you.</p><p>Mindful you has time to think, and to focus. Related to this phenomenon, and partly due to it, there are two thoughts I would like to mention.</p><p>However, first those promised pictures! I tried to make a representative selection from the few hundred photos that I took.</p><div class=figure><p><a data-rel=lightbox-image-0 data-rl_caption data-rl_title href=http://cpbotha.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wpid-mjejane_elephant.jpg title><img alt src=http://cpbotha.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wpid-mjejane_elephant-300x225.jpg></a></p></div><div class=figure><p><a data-rel=lightbox-image-1 data-rl_caption data-rl_title href=http://cpbotha.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wpid-mjejane_rhino.jpg title><img alt src=http://cpbotha.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wpid-mjejane_rhino-300x225.jpg></a></p></div><p>I guess there’s a reason they call it the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crocodile_River_(Mpumalanga)>Crocodile River</a>:</p><div class=figure><p><a data-rel=lightbox-image-2 data-rl_caption data-rl_title href=http://cpbotha.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wpid-mjejane_crocodiles1.jpg title><img alt src=http://cpbotha.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wpid-mjejane_crocodiles1-300x225.jpg></a></p></div><p>After days of searching for them, we finally ran into five young male lions during an early morning drive. Much excitement between the rangers and in our car, with the lions just outside of touching distance. The ranger told us that they see the car as a non-threatening animal, and that somehow us pink and soft humans sitting inside are not interesting, in spite of the large (about lion-sized) open windows:</p><div class=figure><p><a data-rel=lightbox-image-3 data-rl_caption data-rl_title href=http://cpbotha.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wpid-mjejane_lion.jpg title><img alt src=http://cpbotha.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wpid-mjejane_lion-300x225.jpg></a></p></div><p>Finally, I was very lucky to catch this dramatic hippopotamus face-off. You knew they were huge, but did you know they could move this fast? Watch them chase each other and then face off, concurrently marking territory by, uhm, spraying faeces around with their little wagging tails. Fascinating!</p><div class=jetpack-video-wrapper><span class=embed-youtube style=text-align:center;display:block><iframe allowfullscreen class=youtube-player height=473 src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/snrHHa7vnfU?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&autohide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent" style=border:0 type=text/html width=840></iframe></span></div><p>Still with me?! Here are those two backyard philosophy(ish) thoughts I promised:</p><h2 id=you-are-turning-into-a-cyborg>You are turning into a cyborg.</h2><p>We are all slowly turning into cyborgs.</p><p>We have our always-connected smartphones, our tablets, our laptops, and soon we will have heads-up displays always in front of our eyes (<a href=http://cpbotha.net/2009/10/18/futuristic-betting-at-visweek-2009/>I called it in 2009</a>, I think Google read my blog post). Probably due to our foraging nature and the accompanying neuro-chemistry, we find it incredibly hard to resist the call of email, of facebook, of twitter. <i>What if something new and interesting appears?</i> There’s a lovely dopamine shot waiting right there.</p><p>On top of this empire of connected technology, we build intricate systems to keep track of our time, our responsibilities and all of the odd bits of information that we come across. Heaven forbid that we forget anything! We open up as many pathways to capture as much as possible of our environment.</p><p>What happens when we are able to switch all of this off temporarily? Well, initially nothing much. Internally, business continues as usual. There’s no more incoming information, but our brains keep on going.</p><p>However, after a while things start calming down. All of the little thoughts fall away, leaving the big and important ones. Life starts coalescing, becoming more integrated again. Because all of the little stones are temporarily out of the way, it seems that one is able to move the really big rocks. It’s a strange and exhilarating experience.</p><p>So, busy-you makes way for mindful-you. Loads of small thoughts and some big ones make way for a few big ones.</p><p>With this, I’m not saying that we should fight the cyborgs that we are becoming. I think we should embrace our future. We <i>need</i> to be more knowledgeable and more connected to our fellow humans. We <i>need</i> to integrate with our technology. I do wonder how we can unite all this with being more mindful.</p><p>Is it possible to learn how to switch digital you on and off on demand?</p><h2 id=south-africa-you-are-the-most-interesting-place-in-the-world>South Africa, you are the most interesting place in the world.</h2><p>(to me)</p><p>Before I left for Europe 14 years ago, I used to want South Africa to play more to its European influences, to <i>be</i> more European.</p><p>In the years since then, I’ve had the pleasure to live in one of the prettiest little cities in The Netherlands, and to spend vacation time in Italy, in the south of Spain, in the south of France, in Greece and in Sardinia (technically Italy, but I mention it separately because it was that awesome). I’ve also had the pleasure to spend work time in Germany, Norway and Sweden. Altogether, this is a not too shabby sampling of Western Europe.</p><p>What I’ve seen is beautiful, and it has been a superb growing experience making the connections between my European heritage and its various sources.</p><p>Exploring these connections has also helped me to better understand the African influences that have partially formed me, and are the foundations of South Africa. Added to this, I’ve had the distinct privilege of being a tourist in my own country together with Dutch friends. This was perhaps the most acute eye opener. I’ve come to appreciate that Africanness of which I once thought that it should be moved slightly more to the background.</p><p>So here I am now. SA is a fantastically interesting place. It’s a beautiful country, but, more relevantly, it’s currently in a huge state of flux. I’m happy to be able to play a small role in trying to redefine the strange little subculture that I belong to. I’m doing my best to connect more with fellow South Africans.</p><p>I am optimistic that the country will be able to define its own voice; that it will integrate everyone, even its seemingly out of place European children, in a uniquely <i>South</i> African cocktail.</p></div><div class=article-toc><h3>Contents</h3><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><ul><li><a href=#you-are-turning-into-a-cyborg>You are turning into a cyborg.</a></li><li><a href=#south-africa-you-are-the-most-interesting-place-in-the-world>South Africa, you are the most interesting place in the world.</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div><footer class=article-footer><ul class=article-tag-list><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/backyard-philosophy>backyard philosophy</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/crocodile>crocodile</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/cyborgs>cyborgs</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/disconnecting>disconnecting</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/hippopotamus>hippopotamus</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/kruger-national-park>kruger national park</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/lion>lion</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/mindfulness>mindfulness</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/rhino>rhino</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/south-africa>south africa</a></li></ul></footer></div><nav id=article-nav><a href=/2014/07/22/weekly-head-voices-78-aeroimpressed/ id=article-nav-newer class=article-nav-link-wrap><div class=article-nav-title><span>&lt;</span>&nbsp;
