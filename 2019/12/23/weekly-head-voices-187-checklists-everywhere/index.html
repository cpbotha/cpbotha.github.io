Fiery sky in Betty's Bay. I&rsquo;m not sure about the situation in the Northern hemisphere, but down here in the South it seems as if just about everyone has disconnected for the Christmas period.

the South it seems as if just about everyone has disconnected for the Christmas
period.</p><p>I decided that I would prefer at least trying to end the year with a few
more-or-less on time WHVs, even if they have to slim down a bit to do so.</p><p>So here we are: Just you and me. Maybe just me.</p><p>This WHV looks back on the week from Monday December 16 to Sunday December 22, 2019.</p><h2 id=the-last-work-week-of-2019-partially-in-bullets>The last work-week of 2019, (partially) in bullets.</h2><p>For me this was the last <em>real</em> work week.</p><p>I did spend most of it working from places other than the office, which was
nice.</p><p>Other than that, I would like to mention the following noteworthy learnings and
events:</p><ul><li>Schlepping along my Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop keyboard (current
favourite) and mouse, as well as my collapsible laptop stand (to bring the
laptop screen up to eye height) made a huge positive difference to my
ergonomics. 12/10 would do again.</li><li>We had a gratifying 4 day turn-around from the report of a pretty
obscure and initially irreproducible bug, through analysis and debugging, to
a new Windows driver release.</li><li><a href=https://github.com/projectstorm/react-diagrams>react-diagrams</a> is an
amazing TypeScript library for putting together a boxes and lines frontends
to manipulate graph-based dataflow backends. However, the TypeScript class
hierarchies and lack of documentation complicate customisation, if that&rsquo;s
your goal. I had to throw out that work and start over, building everything
on React (<a href=https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html>hooks</a> all the way
baby!) and little bits of d3 for the spliny bits.</li><li>In the same vein, <a href=https://github.com/tgdwyer/WebCola>Cola.js / WebCola</a> is
an impressive layout approach for graphs. The force-directed layout in d3 is
great for interactive demos, but sometimes you want something that, you know,
lays out the graph. See this <a href=https://js.cytoscape.org/demos/2ebdc40f1c2540de6cf0/>cytoscape
demo</a> for even more
fun.</li></ul><h2 id=on-checklists>On checklists.</h2><p>During this last week, as I was fighting to maintain the last islands of focus
being relentlessly eroded by the persistent seas of vacation-temptation, I was
helped a great deal by micro-checklists.</p><p>I briefly debated calling them multi-scalar checklists, but they are really
just normal checklists, except applied to any duration of work or focus time.</p><p>In other words, given an hour in the evening to spend on research, I would
start the hour by quickly jotting down (in Emacs Orgmode of course) a checklist
of the 4 to 5 things I would like to get done in that hour.</p><p>It was surprising to me much that 5 minute time investment would return in the
subsequent 55.</p><p>The lesson that I am taking from this, is that <a href=http://localhost:1313/2019/09/21/note-taking-strategy-2019/#daily-review>my daily planning
checklist</a>
is not enough.</p><p>The daily landscape itself, my energy levels and my interest change far too
much and too quickly for a single daily checklist.</p><p>When you only get a few hours here and there to work, this problem is even more acute.</p><p>I am still figuring out how exactly to cultivate this new habit of making a new
checklist before every block of work, multiple times per day.</p><p>(What exactly is a block of work? Practically, how can I delineate this during
the day?)</p><h2 id=on-disconnecting-for-recuperation>On disconnecting for recuperation.</h2><p>During this time of the year I&rsquo;m usually spending a number of mental cycles
debating how exactly to disconnect from The Network.</p><p>(See <a href=/2014/07/16/a-south-african-state-of-mindful/#you-are-turning-into-a-cyborg>You are turning into a
cyborg</a>
from a 2014 Weekly Head Voices, for example.)</p><p>Even longer ago than that, I used to keep my work and personal email separate.</p><p>During vacations, I would temporarily remove the work account from all of my
devices so that I could only see the mostly social-related personal emails.</p><p>These days, work and personal networks seem to have become even more
intertwined all by themselves, complicating measures like the above.</p><p>When I re-joined the Exciting World of Business and Great Success in 2013, I
merged all of my email back into a single account, for better knowledge
management and especially retrieval.</p><p>Another more important and more current example of this is WhatsApp, which more
or less dominates all instant messaging and a great deal of general
communication down here.</p><p>Many people I know use WhatsApp for work.</p><p>However, most of them, probably like most of you, use a single phone with a
single SIM.</p><p>This means that they will probably see work-related messages and activities
during their vacation, traditionally, but now perhaps increasingly
anachronistically, a period of disconnection.</p><p>(By the way, see <a href=/2011/02/05/postmodern-creativity-weekly-head-voices-37/>me in 2011 recommending WhatsApp over
SMS</a> when WhatsApp
was still quite small, and see <a href=/2016/01/02/when-we-can-lets-use-signal-instead-of-whatsapp/>me in 2016 recommending Signal over
WhatsApp</a>. Signal
is still the best choice by far if you value your privacy and security.)</p><p>Personally, it feels like my current adventure in the Exciting World of
Business and Great Success requires me to be available, just in
case. Therefore, I am planning only a very few days of &ldquo;offline&rdquo;, which is more
of a mental state than a technological setting.</p><p>Other than that, my colleagues are all really great about staying off the
emails and the WhatsApps, partly because they <em>are</em> really great (see above)
and partly because they are applying similar methods.</p><p>The only question that remains is, how much disconnection, and at which
intensity, does the disconnecting human require for optimal functioning?</p><p>Friends, whatever your level of disconnect, I wish you maximum rest.</p><figure><a href=https://cpbotha.net/2019/12/23/weekly-head-voices-187-checklists-everywhere/bettys_rocks.jpg><img sizes="(min-width: 35em) 1200px, 100vw" srcset='https://cpbotha.net/2019/12/23/weekly-head-voices-187-checklists-everywhere/bettys_rocks_hufd20b379848dff4c50dee7269192e3d2_2299980_480x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 480w
