Sunday September 8, 2019.</p><h2 id=on-friendship-25-years-later>On friendship, 25 years later.</h2><p>The birthday <a href=/2019/09/01/weekly-head-voices-176-cycle-of-life/#celebration>mentioned
previously</a>,
along with the portentous visit of a good friend from afar, led to at least two
small celebrations (that I know of) with a bunch of us that have been friends
for more than 25 years now.</p><p>In the bigger scheme of things, it&rsquo;s not <em>that</em> long, but what I would like to
mention here is how much such friendships can grow into the most honest of
human connections.</p><p>It is as if with the passing years, one is able to shed all of the unnecessary
baggage one tends to carry around as a beginner human.</p><p>What is left, is pure human warmth, unconditional support and, perhaps most
significantly, the effortless loss of self.</p><p><em>You</em> fade away, quite happily so, when one of your friends gets up in the
light to tell a story.</p><p>For a while at least, one&rsquo;s only representative in the conversation is one&rsquo;s
undivided recognition of and attention to the other.</p><p>This is certainly not reserved for 25+ year friendships, although this
pre-requisite seems to facilitate the process to the point of effortlessness.</p><h2 id=nested-headings-of-miscellany-nhom-nhom>Nested Headings of Miscellany (NHoM-NHoM).</h2><h3 id=org-pdf-tools-for-constructing-unifying-notes>org-pdf-tools for constructing unifying notes.</h3><p>Recently, I had to work through a stack of regulatory documents in PDF format.</p><p>The challenge was that the documents described different aspects of a single,
complicated procedure, but were severely lacking in overview-engendering
outlines or, even better, diagrams.</p><p>I did what I mostly do when faced with any research-related complexity: BUST
OUT SOME MORE OF THAT EMACS!</p><p>I found the Emacs package
<a href=https://github.com/fuxialexander/org-pdftools/>org-pdftools</a>, which I then
<a href=https://github.com/fuxialexander/org-pdftools/pull/4>PRd to work on my newer
Orgmode</a> (github makes
this sort of collaboration so easy!) and then integrated into my workflow.</p><p>org-pdftools enables one to link to specific annotated extracts, created
on-demand inside Emacs, from one&rsquo;s orgmode notes.</p><p>I used this to synthesise an overview document explaining the whole process,
linking to different parts of multiple PDFs explaining each aspect in more
detail.</p><p>Being able to jump effortlessly from a central overview document to specific
positions in reference PDFs is a huge boon to the research process.</p><h3 id=escalante>Escalante!</h3><p>One friend of work pointed me at an online source of affordable Altras.</p><p>I have secretly been pining for a pair of these shoes.</p><p>I was planning to use them for the longer runs when I can feel that my feet
need a little more support than my sandals are able to provide.</p><p>However, my feet have really gotten used to the wide open spaces of sandals, or
even better, of going barefoot.</p><p>Altras are zero-drop shoes, with <em>ginormous</em> toe boxes. Their motto is &ldquo;Embrace
the Space&rdquo;.</p><p>It seems like I have found some shoes with the right motto&mldr;</p><figure><a href=https://altrarunning.com/><img sizes="(min-width: 35em) 1200px, 100vw" srcset src=https://cpbotha.net/2019/09/09/weekly-head-voices-177-streakers/altra-foot-space.jpg></a></figure><p>Friend #1&rsquo;s recommendation had shoes that were semi-affordable, contrary to my
expectation.</p><p>When I pointed friend #2 from work at friend #1&rsquo;s recommendation, he pointed me
at an even <em>more</em> affordable source.</p><p>I <em>could</em> have continued with this iterative process, but I was unable to delay
this purchase any longer.</p><p>My new pair of Altra Escalante 1.0s arrived the next day.</p><p>(Yes, I know, 1.5 and 2.0 are available. However, <a href=https://runrepeat.com/altra-escalante>the stellar reviews of
1.0</a> have not changed, and did I say
&ldquo;affordable&rdquo;?!)</p><p>On Friday I broke them in, and on Sunday I made a slightly longer than normal
run (see in-progress photo above) to see how they did.</p><p>Anyways, in spite of the rest of me taking quite a beating on the second run, I
can happily report that the shoes did a marvellous job of balancing support
on the one hand and foot-freedom on the other.</p><h2 id=life-optimisation-tip-73-streak-more>Life optimisation tip #73: Streak more.</h2><p>As I was scrolling aimlessly through my facebook feed during my last session
before the Great Social Media Fast of September 2019 (see next section), I
quite ironically ran into a truly interesting post by a Swedish visualization
colleague (SVC).</p><p>In this post, he talked about his hobby and progress as a <em>run streaker</em>.</p><p>It turns out that there are runners with the <em>excellent</em> additional hobby of
<em>streaking</em>, which in <em>this</em> context refers to the act of running every single
day of their lives, and trying to do these daily runs for the longest
continuous streak possible.</p><p>The streakers know of each other, almost like Highlander, and are in a friendly
competition, very much unlike Highlander.</p><p>SVC now has a single uninterrupted streak, spanning multiple years, of daily
running behind him. He has friends in his city who have also been streaking for
multiple years now.</p><p>I find this fantastic, both specifically as a running and fitness feat, and
more generally as a brilliant human optimisation trick.</p><p>The longer your streak, the harder it&rsquo;s going to become to break that
streak. Add in the friendly competition element, and you have become an
accomplishment machine.</p><p>I see great potential here in the context of
<a href=/2019/06/30/weekly-head-voices-172-abc/#always-be-compounding>compounding</a>
more consistently, and for longer.</p><p>What else could we streak folks?</p><h2 id=the-great-social-media-fast-of-2019>The Great Social Media Fast of 2019.</h2><p>Twitter, Facebook, Reddit and friends&mldr; hot durnit.</p><p>Because I recently re-acquired the habit of checking reddit and twitter
multiple times during the day, I again examined the mechanisms driving this
undesirable behaviour.</p><p>The insidiousness, at least for me, lies in the fact that TwiFRaF (twitter,
facebook, reddit and friends) always has something looking like new information
on tap, where with tap, I mean firehose.</p><p>At any given moment during the day, when brain desires new input, or is just
tired and would like to take a break, TwiFRaF firehoses are ready to spew
something that appears to be new information but is only a very convincing
analogue.</p><p>Brain thinks it&rsquo;s getting what it wanted, plus a tiny and uninspired spurt of
discovery-dopamine here and there, which helps to keep up the illusion.</p><p>Any chance of real curiousity taking its natural course is cancelled.</p><p>Instead of pondering a question, and then going out on a slow and deliberate
search for information and later enlightenment, the firehose is opened, because
it&rsquo;s easier.</p><p>Furthermore, brain is unnecessarily exhausted trawling through a mix of mostly
generic rubbish with, granted, an interesting nugget every blue moon.</p><p>Hot durnit.</p><p>Fortunately, I like experiments, and Cold Turkey is my middle name!</p><p>So, on Saturday I decided to cut out TwiFRaF completely.</p><p>Initially I thought it would be an experiment until the end of September, but
now I&rsquo;m thinking that streaking might be an even better option.</p><p>We&rsquo;ll see.</p></div><div class=article-toc><h3>Contents</h3><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><ul><li><a href=#on-friendship-25-years-later>On friendship, 25 years later.</a></li><li><a href=#nested-headings-of-miscellany-nhom-nhom>Nested Headings of Miscellany (NHoM-NHoM).</a><ul><li><a href=#org-pdf-tools-for-constructing-unifying-notes>org-pdf-tools for constructing unifying notes.</a></li><li><a href=#escalante>Escalante!</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#life-optimisation-tip-73-streak-more>Life optimisation tip #73: Streak more.</a></li><li><a href=#the-great-social-media-fast-of-2019>The Great Social Media Fast of 2019.</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div><footer class=article-footer><ul class=article-tag-list><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/altra>altra</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/birthday>birthday</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/compounding>compounding</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/dopamine>dopamine</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/emacs>emacs</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/escalante>escalante</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/friendship>friendship</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/orgmode>orgmode</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/running>running</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/social-media>social media</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/streaking>streaking</a></li></ul></footer></div><nav id=article-nav><a href=/2019/09/21/note-taking-strategy-2019/ id=article-nav-newer class=article-nav-link-wrap><div class=article-nav-title><span>&lt;</span>&nbsp;
