</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Last week, <a href=/2019/04/08/weekly-head-voices-168-postcards-from-the-edge/#nim-surprise>I had happily started diving into the nim language and its
ecosystem</a>.</p><p>I was quite happy to hear that in addition to the enjoyment it had given me,
the spark had jumped over to at least one other peep (O HAI THERE S!) via
these writings.</p><p>However, after getting deeper into <a href=https://github.com/dom96/jester/issues/194>jester&rsquo;s multi-threading
intricacies</a> and discovering that
I could not get run-time confirmation that my requests were being handled by
separate threads, I returned to my initial target language for this experiment of
rewriting, namely f#!</p><p>nim is really a great little experiment: It consists of higher level
abstractions that compile down to C, and it&rsquo;s quite amazing to see what this
enables one to do.</p><p>However, I require something richer and more functional for my language
learning slot.</p><p>As I have written previously, <a href=/2018/07/17/weekly-head-voices-148-data-stylist/#f>f# hits all six of my 2018
PL-requirements</a>.</p><p>In addition to the qualities of the language itself, <a href=https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-preview-3/>dotnet core 3, currently
at preview
3</a>, is
showing great progress, also in terms of memory efficiency and raw
performance.</p><p>I spent some time during the past week to re-re-implement my
nim-re-implementation of parts of isso, again purely for learning purposes.</p><p>(As an aside, it&rsquo;s interesting how close such a real-world example enables one
to get to using a tool or language <em>in anger</em>.)</p><p>Here&rsquo;s a fragment from my learning experiment, because if you&rsquo;re like me
you&rsquo;ll want to see what f# looks like:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#586e75;background-color:#eee8d5;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-fsharp data-lang=fsharp><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#859900>let</span> <span style=color:#268bd2>getCommentsHandler</span> : <span style=color:#268bd2>HttpHandler</span> =

aka my growing collection of Really Interesting PDFs, and I hand-picked a few
tidbits worthy of casually mentioning during the undoubtedly erudite
discussion at your next cocktail party!</p><h3 id=each-millilitre-of-vosub2sub-max-reduces-your-risk-of-dying-by-28>Each millilitre of VO<sub>2</sub> max reduces your risk of dying by 2.8%.</h3><p>If we&rsquo;ve run (I see what I did there) into each other more than once, <a href=/2018/10/23/weekly-head-voices-156-karma-chameleon/#grab-bag-of-thought-and-or-debate-provoking-pieces>I&rsquo;ve
probably
mentioned</a>
last year&rsquo;s publication of the Cleveland treadmill study where they put 122000
people on a treadmill (the study took 20 years) to show that being unfit on a
treadmill is at least as risky (in terms of you dying) as being a smoker.</p><p>Well, last week the result of an even larger Swedish study, with 316137
participants, <a href=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-04/esoc-mmt040819.php>were reported at EuroPrevent
2019</a>.</p><p>With each additional millilitre of oxygen per kilogram of body mass per minute
(<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VO2_max>VO<sub>2</sub> max, a cardiorespiratory fitness
measure</a>), the risk of all-cause
mortality fell by 2.8%, and the risk of cardiovascular events fell by 3.2%.</p><p>According to at least <a href=https://www.topendsports.com/testing/norms/vo2max.htm>one
source</a>, the range
between poor and excellent VO<sub>2</sub> max in most age segments for men and
women is 20 millilitres or more.</p><p>At 2.8% per millilitre, that certainly makes one think!</p><h3 id=hpv-vaccine-linked-to-dramatic-drop-in-cervical-disease>HPV vaccine linked to dramatic drop in cervical disease.</h3><p>Almost exactly 10 years ago, I wrote <a href=/2009/05/21/you-must-vaccinate/>a post on this blog titled &ldquo;You must
vaccinate&rdquo;</a> because friends and acquaintances
were asking questions which I found surprising on the one hand and quite
alarming on the other.</p><p>At that point I thought that even the slowest among us would have caught up to
the fact that there are an extremely large number of good reasons to
vaccinate, and almost none not to.</p><p>It seems that I over-estimated the capabilities and size of the slow group&mldr;</p><p>It is now 10 years later, and the anti-vaxxers have managed to <a href=https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/29-11-2018-measles-cases-spike-globally-due-to-gaps-in-vaccination-coverage>bring measles
(and some friends) back from
extinction</a>.</p><p>Fortunately, there is also much to celebrate on the vaccination front.</p><p>Scotland started with their <a href=https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/human-papillomavirus>human
papillomavirus</a>
vaccination programme 10 years ago, administering the vaccine to girls when
they are at around 12 years of age.</p><p>Researchers now say that since then the HPV vaccine has <a href=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-47803975>&ldquo;nearly wiped out
cases of cervical pre-cancer in young
women&rdquo;</a>.</p><p>What&rsquo;s also heartening is that unvaccinated women also showed a reduction in
disease, implying that the immunisation programme is protecting even more
humans from the disease due to the herd effect.</p><p>(GOU#1 had her HPV shot at school last year. There were parents who
complained. I don&rsquo;t know if there were any refusers.)</p><p>I am still hopeful that one day all of these victories will contribute to the
attrition of the irresponsibly dangerous anti-vaxx movement.</p><h3 id=how-the-matrix-built-a-bullet-proof-legacy>How The Matrix Built A Bullet-Proof Legacy.</h3><p>Surprise! This one is not from science, but it was such an amazing read that I

meetup, organised by <a href=https://wogan.blog/>Wogan May</a> (pssst, he has a
personal blog with mostly weekly updates!) and myself, <a href=http://johan.beyers.co.za/>Johan
Beyers</a> talked about the personal resolution of
doing a given amount of (personal) writing every day.</p><p>I try to do it once weekly with the WHV, and I mostly manage to make a few
bullet points detailing my exploits every day, but the idea of additionally
writing a few more prose-like paragraphs of thoughts every day really
resonates with me.</p><p>Derek Sivers (he was a famous startup-person even before the whole startup
boom, thanks <a href=https://twitter.com/gerwindehaan>Gerwin de Haan</a> for that book
so many years ago!) <a href=https://sivers.org/dj>makes a good case for writing a few diary-like sentences
every evening</a>.</p><p>What&rsquo;s even more intriguing, is his suggestion to maintain separate &ldquo;Thoughts
On&rdquo; journals for various topics that you think about often. In my case, these
could be for example &ldquo;Thoughts on Programming Languages&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Thoughts on
mindfulness for children&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Thoughts on the WHV rules for a contented
life&rdquo;, and so on.</p><p>I think it would be a cunning plan to give both of these additional writing
practices a good go.</p><p>Let me know in the comments what you think!</p><figure><a href=strand_running_clouds_on_mountains.jpg><img sizes="(min-width: 35em) 1200px, 100vw" srcset='https://cpbotha.net/2019/04/15/weekly-head-voices-169-a-cunning-plan/strand_running_clouds_on_mountains_hu38426c04232e1444bb0c0608208a1e21_2519865_480x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 480w
