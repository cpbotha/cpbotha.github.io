err, advisor) to return to announcing new WHVs on Facebook and perhaps even on
Twitter, in spite of
<a href=/2019/10/07/weekly-head-voices-180-ensembleyou-and-the-describers/#twifraf-progress-report>TwiFRaF-YT</a>.</p><p>For the past months, the only place where you could opt in to be notified of
new WHVs was on the mailing list. (Well, that and RSS, which seems to be
becoming more niche with every passing day.)</p><p>Although the mailing list works for a number of people, I am interested in
adding other options that would make sense for WHV readers.</p><p>Readers, where else would be a good place to keep you up to date about new WHV
posts, should you like to be kept up to date?</p><h2 id=what-i-did-in-week-41>What I did in week 41.</h2><p>This was a great week for social events.</p><p>It was not the best week for avoiding amazing craft beer and even more amazing
wine.</p><p>(I knew what I was getting into when the week started. I committed to it.)</p><p>On Tuesday evening, I really enjoyed our local Helderberg business and nerdery
meetup.</p><p>Two &ldquo;lightning&rdquo; talks were given: The first on getting your podcasting game on
(microphones, syndication, oh my!), and the second on personal knowledge
management, based on the recently published <a href=/2019/09/21/note-taking-strategy-2019/>note-taking post on this
blog</a>.</p><p>Craft beer was enjoyed.</p><p>The next day, at a regular(ish) Top Secret Business Meeting (at the Thirsty
Scarecrow), I made use of the opportunity to drink my favourite IPA of all time
(so far), a beer which goes by the name of WARLORD, and a beer that has been
<a href=/2018/03/18/weekly-head-voices-136-slightly-more-than-nothing-much/#new-beer-warlord>documented before on these
pages</a>.</p><p>As the tasting ceremony started, I was greeted by this portentous sign:</p><figure><a href=https://cpbotha.net/2019/10/17/weekly-head-voices-181-the-slow-ones/warlord_bone_crusher_phear_me_rawr.jpg><img sizes="(min-width: 35em) 1200px, 100vw" srcset='https://cpbotha.net/2019/10/17/weekly-head-voices-181-the-slow-ones/warlord_bone_crusher_phear_me_rawr_hu8547bac2bf22040485a698e616ed2557_2139205_480x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 480w

re-opened Long Table restaurant at Haskell Winery.</p><p>The view from one&rsquo;s lunch table looked something like this:</p><figure><a href=https://cpbotha.net/2019/10/17/weekly-head-voices-181-the-slow-ones/long_table_lunch_view.jpg><img sizes="(min-width: 35em) 1200px, 100vw" srcset='https://cpbotha.net/2019/10/17/weekly-head-voices-181-the-slow-ones/long_table_lunch_view_hu75e13b317c3046d4c0a670365b52da6d_4319041_480x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 480w

sat there drinking in the view with my own eyes, like a crazy person.</figcaption></figure><p>As if that was not enough, we had the exquisite pleasure of making the
acquaintance of the Haskell Anvil 2018, probably the best Chardonnay I have
ever tasted.</p><h3 id=running-with-fluids-and-fuel-1210-going-to-do-again>Running with fluids and fuel. 12/10 going to do again.</h3><p>On Sunday, I went out on a long run, partly to atone for my sins but mostly just
because I really like going on long runs.</p><p>What was special about this run, is that I took along extra fluids for the
first time ever.</p><p>Weekend runs these days are mostly longer than an hour.</p><p>After an hour of running on a sunny day down here, one loses quite an amount of
moisture. If this moisture is not replenished, one&rsquo;s running equipment starts
to malfunction.</p><p>To prevent this situation, I recently acquired a <a href=https://runnerclick.com/camelbak-circuit-vest-review/>Camelbak Circuit 1.5l
Hydration vest</a>.</p><p>On Sunday, I took this vest out for its maiden voyage. It had about a litre of
Game (local cheap isotonic drink) in the bladder, and two bananas stuffed in
the front pockets.</p><p>Subjectively, the run went better than usual and I was able to increase my
distance by a little, but gratifying, bit.</p><p>However, next time I&rsquo;m filling that bladder to capacity.</p><p>The angst-inducing sound which that thing makes when you suck out the last few
drops of drink with some distance still left to go is not something I want to
hear again soon.</p><h2 id=solar>Solar</h2><p>For the first time since <a href=/2019/06/30/weekly-head-voices-172-abc/#solar-powerrrrrrrr>our house was
solarized</a>, this
thing happened on Saturday morning at 7:18:</p><figure style=width:400px><a href=https://cpbotha.net/2019/10/17/weekly-head-voices-181-the-slow-ones/solar24.png><img sizes="(min-width: 35em) 1200px, 100vw" srcset='https://cpbotha.net/2019/10/17/weekly-head-voices-181-the-slow-ones/solar24_huc0e0be8262e3fdc02622910aa5b89973_156000_480x0_resize_box_3.png 480w' src=https://cpbotha.net/2019/10/17/weekly-head-voices-181-the-slow-ones/solar24.png></a></figure><p>The house&rsquo;s batteries were still at 24%, but the sun was already high enough to
meet our modest energy demands at that point.</p><p>In other words, for the first time, we had stored enough solar power the
previous day to get us 100% through the night and back into solar, without us
having to dip into the grid.</p><p>(The inverter is programmed not to let the lithium batteries discharge below
20%, in order to further increase their lifespan. When there&rsquo;s a real power
outage, it will go down to 10%.)</p><p>This should happen more often now that the days are getting longer.</p><p>I derive a <em>substantial</em> amount of pleasure from every single kilowatt-hour of
sunbeam-powered electricity that we generate and use.</p><h2 id=first-rule-of-blogging-you-dont-blog-about-blogging>First rule of blogging: You don&rsquo;t blog about blogging.</h2><p>According to <a href=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/12/blogging-twenty-five-years-old-all-grown-up>this Guardian
article</a>,
blogging turned 25 on Monday, October 7, 2019.</p><p>They define the start of blogging as the birth of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Winer>Dave
Winer&rsquo;s</a> first blog post in 1994. It
turns out that Winer has posted to his blog on every single day since that very
first year.</p><p><a href=https://youtu.be/QFKtHSlaMVI>RESTECP!</a></p><p>I like how the Guardian article juxtaposes blogging with modern social media.</p><p>Of course the truth is more complicated, but generally blogging is more about
the content, and the reasoning, albeit just as opinionated, behind it, whereas
social media is all about emotion-driven <em>engagement</em> and extremely short-term
gratification-analogues of some kind or another.</p><h2 id=the-slow-ones>The Slow Ones.</h2><p>Complementing <a href=/2019/06/30/weekly-head-voices-172-abc/#always-be-compounding>ABC</a>, I
feel another (old) theme brewing amongst the voices&mldr;</p><p>Deliberate, deep and slow thinking and doing, is an additional antidote to the
all-encompassing AI-optimised immediate gratification information environment
that we live in, and to humankind&rsquo;s concomitant addiction to all that is
instant.</p><p>In a science fiction world, we&rsquo;re going to end up with yet another
schism between humans.</p><p>There will be those who will hold conversations with ten others at the same
time, data streams coming in from twenty more sources in the background,
processing-processing-processing.</p><p>There will be a far smaller group of folks who still command the almost
forgotten art of focusing intently on a single thing for hours on end, without
swiping in any direction.</p><p>Communication between the two groups will become increasingly difficult.</p><p>Will this remain the stuff of fiction?</p></div><div class=article-toc><h3>Contents</h3><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><ul><li><a href=#alternative-whv-notification-modalities>Alternative WHV notification modalities.</a></li><li><a href=#what-i-did-in-week-41>What I did in week 41.</a><ul><li><a href=#running-with-fluids-and-fuel-1210-going-to-do-again>Running with fluids and fuel. 12/10 going to do again.</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#solar>Solar</a></li><li><a href=#first-rule-of-blogging-you-dont-blog-about-blogging>First rule of blogging: You don&rsquo;t blog about blogging.</a></li><li><a href=#the-slow-ones>The Slow Ones.</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div><footer class=article-footer><ul class=article-tag-list><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/blogging>blogging</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/beer>beer</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/camelbak>camelbak</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/compounding>compounding</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/meetup>meetup</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/running>running</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/slow>slow</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/solar>solar</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/thirsty-scarecrow>thirsty scarecrow</a></li></ul></footer></div><nav id=article-nav><a href=/2019/11/02/forming-and-maintaining-habits-using-orgmode/ id=article-nav-newer class=article-nav-link-wrap><div class=article-nav-title><span>&lt;</span>&nbsp;
