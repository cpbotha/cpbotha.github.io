<p>I wish all of you all of the best for this shiny new year twenty-twenty-three!</p>
<p>(By the way, this, the first day of the year, is the earliest that the
yearly transition post has ever appeared!)</p>
<h2 id="blogging">Blogging</h2>
<p>Over the past year, I published fifteen posts on this blog, 14 of which were
&ldquo;weekly&rdquo; head voices posts (#237 to #250), and one <a href="/2022/01/23/the-2021-to-2022-transition-post/">the 2022 transition post</a>.</p>
<p>In an ideal world where I get to divide up my time between family and friends,
blogging, running and Emacs, I might be able to get close to the mythical 52
WHVs per year.</p>
<p>However, for me 2022 was definitely The Year of a Whole Lot of Work.</p>
<p>You might remember <a href="/2022/03/01/weekly-head-voices-239-embarrassing-finitude/#the-rickety-raft-of-life-directions-and-priorities">WHV #239 Embarrassing finitude</a>, in which I observed that you
only get to choose a really small number (probably only two: family and
friends, and one additional project) of significant priorities that you can
effectively contribute to over any given stretch of time.</p>
<p>I mostly remember that I&rsquo;ve made peace with this limitation, and I am realising
that (good) Work might be a crucial and substantial component of a long and
good life.</p>

<p>From this it&rsquo;s clear that I really have to get around to completing that
started-month-ago-but-languishing 202x note-taking strategy update, as my
system has evolved quite substantially.</p>
<p>I did also publish five posts on <a href="https://vxlabs.com/">vxlabs.com</a>, this site&rsquo;s nerdy sibling, which
in its turn attracted just over 147 thousand unique visitor IPs over the year.</p>
<p>The most popular posts from vxlabs were the following, in descending order:</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="selected-learnings-from-2022">Selected learnings from 2022</h3>
<p>I went through all of 2022&rsquo;s WHVs to make an <em>extremely critical</em> (haha)
selection of learnings that bear mention in this yearly overview.</p>
<p>Because I think all of them are worthy of a retrospection, they are
chronologically ordered.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/2022/02/03/weekly-head-voices-237-dont-step-over-the-thing/#i-don-t-want-to-step-over-the-thing">WHV #237 Don&rsquo;t step over the thing</a> &ndash; <em>We’re constantly stepping over the thing that
we think we’re seeking in the act of seeking it.</em> &hellip; <em>You can’t actually
become happy. You can only be happy.</em>
<ul>
<li>Related: <a href="/2022/11/01/weekly-head-voices-247-precious-moments/#take-a-picture-with-your-mind">WHV #247 Take a picture with your mind</a> &ndash; Your narrating self, the
one that needs to take all of those photos, can also take you out of the
thing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="/2022/03/01/weekly-head-voices-239-embarrassing-finitude/#the-rickety-raft-of-life-directions-and-priorities">WHV #239 Embarrassing finitude</a> &ndash; I&rsquo;m going to summarise that post section
here with &ldquo;pick your battles&rdquo;, or for the more poetically inclined readers
&ldquo;choose your f*cks&rdquo;. Our time is extremely limited - it is best to make
extremely deliberate and economical choices about the things that we spend
our time and energy on at any point.</li>
<li><a href="/2022/05/23/weekly-head-voices-242-multiplicity-of-me/">WHV #242 Multiplicity of me</a> &ndash; If you skip everything else, read this
one. It&rsquo;s like &ldquo;happiness for dummies, in 24 hours&rdquo;.</li>
<li><a href="/2022/06/23/weekly-head-voices-243-part-time-role-model/#part-time--role--model">WHV #243 Part-time role model</a> &ndash; Some motivation to never stop trying to be the
best you, also when, inevitably, you&rsquo;ll only have occasional success.</li>
<li><a href="/2022/09/25/weekly-head-voices-246-call-up-your-friends/#call-up-your-friends">WHV #246 Call up your friends</a> &ndash; Do call up that friend you&rsquo;re thinking
up. Write thank-you notes. Send birthday messages. Make the connection!</li>
<li><a href="/2022/11/20/weekly-head-voices-249-self-discipline/#self-discipline">WHV #249 Self-discipline</a> &ndash; Take care of this personal engine and it will
take you places.</li>
<li><a href="/2022/12/06/weekly-head-voices-250-durable-blissful-contentment/#happiness-is-a-joke">WHV #250 Durable, blissful contentment</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="quo-vadis-2023">Quo vadis 2023</h3>
<p>Writing on this here blog, and specifically the WHVs, is important to me for
the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>They enable learning, through retro- and introspection.</li>
<li>Each successful post is an exercise in applied and externalised self-discipline.</li>
<li>I enjoy practising the dying art of writing.</li>
<li>They help to form a connection with other humans, both friends and strangers.</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason for this retro-retrospection here, is that I am evaluating the
(smouldering) results and implications of the tension between post regularity
on the one hand, and self-perceived post substance on the other, over the past
year.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve erred on the side of post substance, when regularity might have been the
better option.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that I was able to control it that deftly; what we have here is merely
the result of trying to publish posts of a reasonable quality at a reasonable
cadence.</p>
<p>My current feeling is that I would like to increase regularity, in spite of
past performance.</p>
<p>To make this happen, I have to learn to be satisfied with somewhat less, and
more importantly, I have to come up with improvements to my blogging workflow
that enable a more predictable flow of material.</p>
<p>A new year won&rsquo;t be a true new year without overly ambitious resolutions, now
will it?</p>
<h2 id="running">Running</h2>
<p>This year, I averaged 20km of running per week for a total of 1044km (118 runs,
just under 99 hours) over the whole year.</p>
<p>Last year I did 25km per week, which is what I would have liked for this year
as well, but this is fine. <em>Any</em> kilometres are better than no kilometres!</p>

<p>I did three quick spot checks in my daily journals to see if I could determine
any specific reasons for the low / no-exercise weeks, but nothing jumped out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to have to blame work for this one too.</p>
<p>Anyways, what I <em>can</em> say, without any hesitation, is that running made a massive
positive contribution to my physical and mental well-being this year.</p>
<p>The effects can generally be immediately felt (that beautiful bit when it feels
like all one&rsquo;s limbs are finally working together, rhythmically even, is
exhilarating), and usually signal another start of a cascade of positive
physiological and life-style factors.</p>
<p>Running resolutions for 2023: 0) Much enjoy. 1) Don&rsquo;t get injured. 2) Try <em>again</em> for the 25km/w average.</p>
<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>
<p>I really enjoyed the following books:</p>
<h3 id="fiction">Fiction</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54906250-project-hail-mary">Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir</a> - feel good edge of seat stranded in space but
have to save the earth human-alien-buddy movie -book. Great for engineers who
know how to suspend disbelief.
<ul>
<li>I could not remember that I had ever bought this book, but enjoyed the
living daylights out of it. Only later discovered that it was GOU #1 (who
shares my Kindle account)! 🥰 we enjoyed the same book!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57357418-termination-shock">Termination Shock by Neal Stephenson</a> - this is such a disciplined, detailed,
diligent piece of science fiction by someone who clearly has <em>practised</em> this
art and honed their craft to perfection. I enjoyed the story (it does require
some reader stamina) and appreciated the massive skills of the artist.</li>
<li><a href="/2022/03/21/weekly-head-voices-240-i-am-just-a-copy-of-a-copy-of-a-copy/#permutation-city">Permutation City by Greg Egan</a> - click on the link to the left to go to my

<h3 id="non-fiction">Non-fiction</h3>

<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59516276-the-unseen-body">The Unseen

various medical emergencies.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="resolutions">Resolutions</h3>
<p>Somewhere in the second half of 2022, I somehow lost my <a href="/2022/01/23/the-2021-to-2022-transition-post/#reading">reading-before-sleep
habit</a>.</p>
<p>I plan to reinstate this habit, and to install the new habit of reading more
books on my phone (vs being limited to my Kindle, which is not always with me).</p>
<p>Armed with these two life-hacks, I hope to finish reading 20 books in 2023.</p>
<p>Please send me your recommendations in the comments below!</p>
<h2 id="systems-and-tools-for-running-this-human">Systems and tools for running this human</h2>
<p>As per tradition, I quote from previous transition posts my explanation of &ldquo;The
System&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The System is Emacs, and orgmode, and multi-scalar note-taking everywhere, and
sketching, and daily habits, and a whole bag of tricks to try and keep this
creaky old frame moving in the right direction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similar to <a href="/2022/01/23/the-2021-to-2022-transition-post/#systems-and-tools-for-running-this-human--pkm-baby">last year</a>, Emacs, Orgmode and Org-roam are still going very strong,
and constitute the lion&rsquo;s share of my personal knowledge management system.</p>
<p>In fact, with the imminent Emacs 29 release, a recent build of which I&rsquo;m typing
this draft into (English is hard folks&hellip;), Emacs has only become <em>more</em>
compelling.</p>
<p>Amongst <a href="https://blog.phundrak.com/emacs-29-what-can-we-expect">many other improvements</a>, tree-sitter, eglot and use-package are now all
part of core.</p>
<h3 id="byeeeeee-dropbox">Byeeeeee Dropbox!</h3>
<p>However&hellip;</p>
<p>The time has finally come for me to drop (again) Dropbox.</p>
<p>Although I have been a paying customer for many years (see <a href="/2010/02/28/weekly-head-voices-15-auto-tune-my-cloud/">WHV #15</a> from
February of 2010 for a report close to the start of our commercial
relationship), in the end it was their intransigence and inscrutability around
the Dropbox Paper 2020 migration that broke the camel&rsquo;s back.</p>
<p>They have been promising since before 2020 that they would migrate all existing
users to the new 2020 edition of Dropbox Paper.</p>
<p>However, now all you can find about this are frustrated forum posts from
long-time customers. My direct support request to be migrated was promptly
answered, and then closed with the following message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As much as I would like to help, currently, the latest version of Paper release
is available to new users only.</p>
<p>Our team is currently in the process of working on this new feature in order to
build the best Paper experience for all our users.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I still really love that tool (winner of the WHV Award for the Most
Unexpectedly Useful Software Tool of the Year 2021!), but the interaction above
only served as a reminder of the pitfalls of a relationship like this.</p>
<p>During the writing of my yet-to-appear 202x note-taking approach blog post, it
bugged me that I had to come up with a good explanation for why I allowed
Dropbox Paper to break my rule of everything-needs-to-be-a-file-I-could-sync.</p>
<p>Although my yearly Dropbox Paper subscription is only up for renewal in June of
&lsquo;23, I decided to bite the bullet and <a href="/2022/11/11/weekly-head-voices-248-oh-snap/#hell-freezes-over--again">migrate everything out to an extremely
frightening mix of OneDrive, syncthing and unison</a>.</p>
<p>As I write this, it&rsquo;s been just over two months with nary a hiccup.</p>
<p>In June, I&rsquo;ll let that Dropbox subscription lapse.</p>
<p>Dropbox Paper, RIP.</p>
<p>(With <a href="https://1writerapp.com/">1writer</a> and also <a href="https://plainorg.com/">Plain Org</a> on the iPhone, and <a href="https://syncthing.net/">syncthing</a> on my main desktop
at home, plus Apple Notes for the truly ephemeral stuff, I have a pretty
capable mobile response to Paper.)</p>
<h3 id="resolutions">Resolutions</h3>
<ol>
<li>I would really like to publish a blog post titled <em>Note-taking approach
2023</em>. Ideally, it should be full of information about my current PKM system.</li>
<li>Write more notes, including both journals and <a href="/tags/zettelkasten/">Zettelkasten-style</a> notes.</li>
<li>Stretch goal: Maybe get another useful patch into Emacs.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="work">Work</h2>
<p>2022 was my first year back in employment, after <a href="/2013/03/09/dear-academia-i-hope-we-can-still-be-friends/">eight years of freelancing</a>.</p>
<p>In this year, I have only become more deeply involved and invested in the
current <a href="https://stonethree.com/">Stone Three</a> adventure.</p>
<p>As I mentioned previously, I have the privilege of working closely together
with extremely capable folks, in a high-trust setting.</p>
<p>Many of my colleagues are smarter than I am in their respective fields. Due to
that, and the fact that we are both growing and innovating, I am constantly
learning.</p>
<p>My personal responsibilities span the spectrum from programming, through
mentor- and leadership to management and org-level technical decisions. On the
other dimension, I am exposed to everything from software plumbing to data
science, engineering and visualization. (This is what&rsquo;s known as a
PiM-situation. PiM = pig in mud)</p>
<p>The work is hard, but it&rsquo;s varied, it&rsquo;s challenging, it&rsquo;s together with a group
of humans I like, and it feels meaningful.</p>
<p>I have written all these words to try and explain that although it&rsquo;s clear from
this post that Work(tm) took up significantly more time and space this year, it
has contributed substantially to my well-being.</p>
<p>Freelancing was less stressful &ndash; I could focus on the engineering tasks at
hand and usually deliver. Now I have more responsibility, which brings
substantially more stress but also more satisfaction.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in terms of maintaining the plasticity of my neural network,
something I do have to pay more and more attention to thanks to the advancing
years, the variation and challenges of my current work setting are great.</p>
<p>That being said, I definitely have to get better at controlling stress.</p>
<h2 id="things-i-would-like-to-work-on-in-2023">Things I would like to work on in 2023</h2>
<p>In addition to the blogging, running, reading and systems resolutions mentioned
above, I would like to work on the following bigger themes in 2023:</p>

<li>Work(tm).</li>
<li>Self-discipline, <a href="/2022/11/20/weekly-head-voices-249-self-discipline/#self-discipline">as featured in WHV #249</a>. I will implement this by writing
really stern messages to me in my diary.</li>
<li>Creating, restoring and maintaining good habits that <a href="/tags/compounding/">compound</a>: Reading,
writing, running, mindfulness practice.</li>
</ol>
<p>&hellip; and then finally, my central theme for 2023 will be:</p>
<h3 id="4-dot-expansiveness">4. Expansiveness</h3>
<p>Sometimes, most probably when you&rsquo;re out in nature, you experience your senses
really opening up.</p>
<p>It is as if the usually clearly defined borders between you and your
surroundings start to fade away.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about this phenomenon before, in <a href="/2021/03/22/weekly-head-voices-217-consciousness-continuum/#the-strange-continuum-of-consciousness">WHV #217&rsquo;s The Strange Continuum
of Consciousness</a> and in other places.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great feeling, and it usually happens when you are fully present in that
moment.</p>
<p>For a while, you can get pleasantly lost in the infinite and fractal detail in
the moment and its participants.</p>
<p>For a while, you can truly appreciate the beauty of your surroundings, of the food
and drink you might be enjoying, and of the humans in your company.</p>
<p>In 2023, let us be expansive!</p>

<p>I am happy that my ever-evolving life philosophy (as well as my approach to
health and wellness) includes a growing section on the importance of hard and
challenging work with great colleagues, because these past few weeks have
really been delivering in that respect.</p>
<p>The rest of this post consists of two main parts: The first is a nerdy bit
about the ease of doing state-of-the-art multi-lingual speech-to-text
transcription on your own computer, and the second is about not being happy.</p>
<h2 id="an-applied-machine-learning-prelude">An applied machine learning prelude</h2>
<p>A few months ago, I listened to a podcast with Sam Harris and Morgan Housel,
titled, quite uncharacteristically for Harris podcasts, &ldquo;Wealth Matters&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Hidden between all of the money- and economics-related information, they
started to talk about human well-being, and specifically about happiness vs
contentment.</p>
<p>As I was driving, a few specific words by Sam Harris dealing with the modest
but robust bliss in everyday contentment really hit home for me.</p>
<p>I made a mental note to find the spot in question later, and then to transcribe
it for this blog.</p>
<p>It went the way of many of my mental notes made while driving and listening to
podcasts&hellip; floating peacefully and oblivious somewhere in my brain.</p>
<p>&hellip; until last week, when the mental note surfaced (!!).</p>
<p>First I graduated the mental note into my Emacs Org mode notes. A few days
later I tracked down the interview in question (man, that Waking Up app has
great content, but it&rsquo;s usability has much room for improvement (low hanging
fruit include 1. automatically continuing current listening and 2. better
search)) and made another note, which on its part led to me sitting down a bit
later with my phone, trying to find the correct spot in the 2 hour podcast.</p>
<p>Fortunately, two attempts got me to the desired segment at 48m55s.</p>
<p>At that point, I could have just manually transcribed the speech in question,
but it turned out to be a longer segment than expected, and then a little voice
(haha) reminded me of <a href="https://openai.com/blog/whisper/">the recent release of OpenAI&rsquo;s multi-lingual
text-to-speech neural network model called Whisper</a>.</p>
<p>In spite of XKCD&rsquo;s extremely valuable <a href="https://xkcd.com/1205/">lessons on when you should or shouldn&rsquo;t
automate a thing</a>, I decided that there was a learning opportunity here and so
I git cloned (nerd for &ldquo;downloaded&rdquo;) the <a href="https://github.com/openai/whisper">Whisper source code</a>.</p>
<p>It took me the most of the time to get the required GPU-capable packages on
Windows, where my RTX 2070 lives (I had to revert to miniforge and conda, see
<code>environment.yml</code> below), and then to record the 6.5 minute audio segment from my
phone using the external microphone on my PC with Audacity (this was the only
way to get the audio out of the app).</p>
<p>Once that was done, Whisper took about a minute (64 seconds to be exact) to
transcribe the 6.5 minutes into absolutely <em>flawless</em>, timestamped English text.</p>
<p>I was quite flabbergasted.</p>
<p>It is now possible to download a pretty compact neural network to your own PC,
and then to use that model to transcribe automatically any number of spoken
languages, optionally also translating in the process.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="happiness-is-a-joke">Happiness is a joke</h2>
<p>The section that really hit home for me is the one in response to this
statement by Morgan Housel, the interview guest:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That difference between happiness and satisfaction is really key and easy to
overlook.  Happiness, like I said earlier, is a very fleeting emotion.</p>
<p>I use the example of, like, if I told you the funniest joke in the world,
you&rsquo;ve never heard a funniest joke, you would laugh for 30 seconds, and then
you&rsquo;d be over it.</p>
<p>And if I told you that joke every day, you&rsquo;d get sick of it, even if it was the
best joke in the world.</p>
<p>Happiness is like that as well, and therefore I think the most that we can aim
for, the best we can aim for, is contentment.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>But when people chase happiness, I think that&rsquo;s when people are setting
themselves up for disappointment, because no matter how funny the joke is, so
to speak, it&rsquo;s a fleeting emotion that sticks around for just very brief
moments before you revert to something else.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a fan of analogies, because they have the tendency to distract folks
from the core of the discussion at hand. In the worst case, people think they
understand the issue because they understand the analogy.</p>
<p>However, here we can say that the world&rsquo;s funniest joke would indeed probably
be as fleeting as that feeling of happiness.</p>
<p>I have heard people joke about Sam Harris, saying he is one of the few humans
who is able to &ldquo;speak in full paragraphs&rdquo;.</p>
<p>His off-the-cuff response, the transcription of which is shown below with my
emphasis, indeed seems to demonstrate that quality.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m a big fan of thinking of well-being in terms of a kind of a <strong>larger
footprint of contentment and equanimity and peace</strong>, you know, non-conflict, as
opposed to the more transitory, hotter experiences of joy and happiness.</p>
<p>I mean, joy is a fleeting emotion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not to say it&rsquo;s not important, and we don&rsquo;t love it.  But there&rsquo;s a kind
of a background context of just not having a problem, which is certainly
underrated.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not something people tend to, when they think of living their best
possible life, people tend to think about joy and fun and even, you know,
ecstasy, and they get bored with words like contentment or peace or equanimity.</p>
<p>And yet, really, when you just look at it, when you study the nature of your
own psychological suffering, really, <strong>the thing that is durable, the thing that
is achievable and, you know, truly enviable</strong>, if you don&rsquo;t have it, <strong>is
contentment</strong>, and it can <strong>deepen to the point where, you know, there&rsquo;s a blissful
component to it</strong>, and it&rsquo;s born of <strong>not craving things that are not here in this
moment</strong>, right?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve <a href="/2017/07/30/weekly-head-voices-124-ceci-nest-pas-dennui/">mentioned at least once before my preference for contentment over
happiness</a>, although I then also cited opinions to the effect that even
contentment was not possible, but I really like the way Sam so eloquently
combines the achievability, the robustness, and <em>especially</em> the bliss that can
be obtained through contentment, which itself can be cultivated through the
active practice of filling the current moment with your full and deliberate
presence.</p>
<h2 id="p-dot-s-dot-about-a-dot-i-dot">P.S. about A.I.</h2>
<p>With the current excitement over all of the applied Large Language Models
(LLMS), especially around the meteoric rise of <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/">ChatGPT</a>, I have resolved to
maintain this blog as a shining example of 100% ad-free and human (namely
me)-generated content.</p>
<p>I have nothing against applying ML, but personally I prefer my blogs as
personal as possible.</p>
<p>It is quite poetic that after making that resolution, I did enlist the help of
an ML model to transcribe the speech in the previous section.</p>
<p>Thinking about this some more, who knows how I might use ML in the future to
help me answer questions, whilst still experiencing that it is truly <em>me</em> who
ends up writing these words.</p>
<p>These distinctions are already quite blurry.</p>
<p>With the technology and its context evolving so rapidly, there&rsquo;s no telling
where this journey will take us.</p>

<h2 id="emacs-mastodon-server-was-irresistible">Emacs Mastodon server was irresistible</h2>
<p>A week or two ago, I was still chatting with friends about how to respond to
the currently in-progress Twitter Muskification.</p>
<p>At that point, largely due to all of the great connections and positive
experience I&rsquo;ve been enjoying on twitter (howto: follow only kind humans who
are involved in your fields of interest; in my case visualization, machine
learning, data, mobility), I commented that I had no plans yet and preferred
waiting for a bit to see how it would pan out.</p>
<p>The topic of <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a> did come up, but the feeling in that tech-savvy group was
that it was perhaps a bit complicated.</p>
<p>In the days since then, the developments at Twitter seemed to have accelerated,
but it&rsquo;s still extremely tricky to predict where all of this will end up.</p>
<p>Also in the days since then, a Swiss gentleman named <a href="https://emacs.ch/@louis">Louis</a> had the nerve ;) to
setup a Mastodon server called <a href="https://emacs.ch">emacs.ch</a>, catering to Emacs enthusiasts&hellip;</p>
<p>CURSES!</p>
<p>I see Emacs, I move.</p>
<p>My account was created a few minutes later, and suddenly Mastodon was not
complicated at all y&rsquo;all!</p>
<p>Things that I really like so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anyone can setup an independent yet connected server that caters to a
specific interest group, such as Emacs users.</li>
<li>Much more engagement and connectedness with other users, thanks to the server
focus.</li>
<li>Early internet feelings: Optimism, grassroots, people.</li>
<li>Fantastic Emacs support. I can <a href="https://emacs.ch/@cpbotha/109337719793270417">read and post directly from Emacs, using the
amazing <code>mastodon.el</code></a>.</li>
<li>No algorithm that re-arranges the posts that you see. What you see is what
your timeline posted, when they posted it.</li>
<li>No ads!</li>
<li>Yes, here you <strong>can</strong> edit your posts after you&rsquo;ve posted them. IT&rsquo;S TRUE.</li>
<li>NO ADS!</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been having fun tracking down friends and colleagues on their various
mastodon servers, and re-making connections.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re also interested, my advice would be to start by <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/servers">searching for a
server</a> (or more than one!) that really suits you.</p>
<p>Then, if you like, you can find <em>me</em> at <a href="https://emacs.ch/@cpbotha">@cpbotha@emacs.ch</a> !</p>
<h2 id="quarto-dot-qmd-looks-like-the-answer-to-my-dot-ipynb-prayers">Quarto .qmd looks like the answer to my .ipynb prayers</h2>
<p>Back in 2018 I talked about <a href="/2018/07/17/weekly-head-voices-148-data-stylist/#vacation-based-thinking-driven-tool-sharpening-aka-the-wvv-2018-data-science-toolboxtm">my complicated feelings for Jupyter Notebooks</a>.</p>
<p>To elaborate a bit, I still do think notebooks are amazing, but they are so
amazing that their design limitations can get in the way.</p>
<p>Most recently, the .ipynb format, which is standard .json representing the
various input cells (code and markdown mainly) and also their outputs (yikes!),
caused issues at work.</p>
<p>Although it&rsquo;s convenient from a notebook user standpoint that you can open up
an ipynb and see the last rendered version of the notebook, it really
complicates source control (diffs), and opening the .ipynb up in a normal
editor to debug issues is not fun at all.</p>
<p>Well, recently, spurred on by the below provocative tweet by Chelsea
Parlett-Pelleriti (who is now also on Mastodon as
<a href="https://nerdculture.de/@chelseaparlett">@chelseaparlett@nerdculture.de</a>):</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Friendship ended with .rmd<br><br>now .qmd is my best friend <a href="https://t.co/7ETH4o2KUH">pic.twitter.com/7ETH4o2KUH</a></p>&mdash; Chelsea @chelseaparlett@nerdculture.de (@ChelseaParlett) <a href="https://twitter.com/ChelseaParlett/status/1591505992805543936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 12, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>&hellip; I decided to take a deeper look at Quarto and especially .qmd.</p>
<p>In short, .qmd is markdown with executable code-cells!</p>
<p>If you take a look at the VSCode-based <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/vscode.html">Get Started guide</a>, you&rsquo;ll see that can
type up .qmd files in any text editor, and then have the quarto cli tool show
you a continuous preview of your work.</p>
<p>The examples they show look <em>really</em> attractive folks!</p>
<p>One of the fundamental improvements here, is that by design outputs are not
stored inside the .qmd file format.</p>
<p>An addition, the top-to-bottom execution of one&rsquo;s notebook is the primary mode
of operation, although cell-based execution is also possible. This is the
opposite of normal notebooks, where the default interactive cell-based
execution often results in the top-to-bottom not being tested, and hence often
being broken.</p>
<p>For my current analytics applications, it looks like we&rsquo;ll be able to use .qmd
as a drop-in replacement for .ipynb.</p>
<p>Although Org mode and org-babel have been doing this (plaintext file with
executable code cells) for a long time now, I am really excited that there&rsquo;s
now a more accessible solution that will hopefully become very popular.</p>
<p>P.S. After all of that, I was additionally thrilled to discover that Dr Carlos
Scheidegger, a brilliant and friendly colleague from the the data visualization
world, was on the core developer team. Here he is <a href="https://emacs.ch/@scheidegger@mastodon.social/109343921680547594">announcing, on Mastodon, the
just-released v1.2 of Quarto</a>!</p>
<h2 id="self-discipline">Self-discipline</h2>
<p>Picture this:</p>
<p>You wake up in the morning, refreshed and ready to take on the day.</p>
<p>With your mind as clear as it&rsquo;ll ever be, you make a list of the things that
you know that you should work on today: Let&rsquo;s call them Things A, B, C and H.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re really passionate about A, but you realise that B and C are at least as
important to your and your family&rsquo;s well-being.</p>
<p>H is just something urgent that you&rsquo;ve postponed for too long and now really
has to be taken care of, or perhaps the H stands for Harbinger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harbinger of what?&rdquo; I hear you think&hellip;</p>
<p>Shortly after this moment of clarity, the day (on some days aka &ldquo;all Hell&rdquo;)
breaks loose and you suddenly have to deal with all of the vagaries of modern
work and life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s starting to feel like the crystalline clarity of a few moments ago might
be just a little too brittle to resist the deluge of chaos.</p>
<p>On your <em>better</em> days, you will be able to keep your eye on Thing A, in spite of
all of the obstacles that stand in your path. Your passion for A helps you to
power through.</p>
<p>On your <em>best</em> days, you will find that quiet determination inside, that modest
but diamond-hard resolve that will enable you to tend to Things B and C in
addition to A, with deliberateness and diligence.</p>
<p>In my view, being able to focus on your passions in spite of challenges on your
path sounds like <strong><em>grit</em></strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip; grit is a positive, non-cognitive trait based on an individual&rsquo;s
perseverance of effort combined with the passion for a particular long-term
goal or end state (a powerful motivation to achieve an objective). This
perseverance of effort promotes the overcoming of obstacles or challenges that
lie on the path to accomplishment and serves as a driving force in achievement
realization. Distinct but commonly associated concepts within the field of
psychology include &ldquo;perseverance&rdquo;, &ldquo;hardiness&rdquo;, &ldquo;resilience&rdquo;, &ldquo;ambition&rdquo;, &ldquo;need
for achievement&rdquo; and &ldquo;conscientiousness&rdquo;. These constructs can be
conceptualized as individual differences related to the accomplishment of work
rather than talent or ability. &ndash; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grit_(personality_trait)">Wikipedia on &ldquo;grit&rdquo;</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whereas I would label the characteristic of being able to continue paying
attention to things that are important but not necessarily your areas of
passion <strong><em>self-discipline</em></strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Resolute adherence to a regimen or course of action in order to achieve one&rsquo;s
goals. &ndash; <a href="https://dictionary.apa.org/self-discipline">definition #2 from the APA Dictionary of Psychology</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Definition #1 on that page is <em>self-control</em>, which seems to be the passive
counterpart (or component) of <em>self-discipline</em>, based on what I can find
online. Unfortunately, what I can find online are mostly second- and third-hand
observations, see e.g. <a href="https://fredericksburg.com/self-control-and-self-discipline-arent-the-same/article_9e91991c-81e8-5a8f-bca0-972e025fbe24.html">quote by Dr. Julia-Marie O&rsquo;Brien #1 without citation</a>,
<a href="https://matthogan.blog/self-discipline-vs-self-control/">same quote #2</a>, <a href="https://selfctrl.com/3-lessons-learned-on-building-self-control/">same quote #3</a> or <a href="https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-difference-between-self-control-and-self-discipline">quora, sorry!</a> &ndash; &ldquo;Self-control says no, or
stop. Self-discipline says go, and keep it going.&rdquo; &ndash; Although I would like to
find better discussion about this, the distinction does make sense.)</p>
<p>Self-discipline is one of those skills that can be practised.</p>
<p>By applying it more often, and especially so when it feels like the going has
gotten tough, you&rsquo;ll be able to apply it more reliably and more consistently in
the future.</p>
<p>Self-discipline is the reliable bridge linking you and your goals, at your
absolute best, with you at all other points.</p>
<p>It can be difficult to keep on practising, but when you can look back on one of
<em>those</em> days, and see how you even managed to take care of Things B and C, in
addition to A, in spite of the adversities on your path, you will experience
quiet satisfaction.</p>
<p>Savour the moment.</p>

<p>(Yes, I am a little bit excited that for once this post is technically on time
enough to cover only that one week. Of course what&rsquo;s in the post does not
necessarily have to do anything with the events that transpired in that week,
but we won&rsquo;t let that keep us from this little punctuality celebration.)</p>
<p>On to the post: We have keyboards, file synchronization approaches and some
surprising mathematical terminology!</p>
<h2 id="keyboard-never-endgame">Keyboard never-endgame</h2>
<p>It has been &hellip;9 (nine)&hellip; months since I last talked about <a href="/tags/keyboards/">keyboards on this
blog</a>.</p>
<p>At that point, <a href="/2022/02/09/weekly-head-voices-238-live-deep-and-suck-out-all-the-marrow-of-life/#womier-k87-keyboard-customization-unlocked">I had just replaced the tactile brown switches in my Womier with
linear reds</a>, and discovered to my surprise that I do in fact prefer linears.</p>
<p>Since then, I have again replaced the switches on that board, but this time
with Kailh Speed Silvers.</p>
<p>My plan was to get as close as possible to the effortlessly smooth feel of my
Varmilo VA87m (with Cherry MX Speed Silvers) at work.</p>
<p>While that board was certainly inching closer, it was still missing a little
something&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip; perhaps, perhaps it was just missing a completely new little new keyboard!</p>
<p>When respected YouTube reviewers call a keyboard with factory-lubed switches,
luxury double-shot PBT OSA-profile keycaps and this particular sound the <a href="https://youtu.be/HVphB6RYBaY">&ldquo;The
Keychron V1 <strong>Bargain</strong>&rdquo;</a>, and other reviewers remark that the only issue with this
board is that you&rsquo;ll be hard-pressed to find one in stock due to its level of
bang-for-buck, you could probably predict that I would find it quite hard to
resist.</p>
<p>I had to pull some (Aramex) strings to get the keyboard delivered here, but
wow, it was so worth it!</p>
<p>Although I was hoping for something close to my Varmilo in terms of feel, this
V1 with its red switches is at least the Varmilo&rsquo;s equal, if not a little more.</p>
<h2 id="hell-freezes-over--again">Hell freezes over (again)</h2>
<p>Readers of this blog know that I&rsquo;ve been <a href="/tags/dropbox/">using (and paying for) Dropbox</a> for
quite a number of years.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been together for long enough that we even got to do a <a href="/2013/09/15/dear-usa-my-data-has-left-your-building/">break-up-make-up
cycle back in 2013</a>, and in 2019 I tried and <a href="/2019/03/09/weekly-head-voices-164-its-what-future-you-would-want/#my-big-and-stupid-misstep-into-google-drive">failed spectacularly to migrate to
a cheaper competitor whose name starts with a G</a>.</p>
<p>One would have thought that I learned my lesson in 2019 (that post even
explicitly lists the lessons learned&hellip;), but apparently not.</p>
<p>After I recently discovered how to get the fantastic <a href="https://vxlabs.com/2022/10/22/unison-file-synchronization-directly-via-the-wsl-bridge/">unison bi-directional
syncing tool to sync between WSL and the Windows host</a>, I decided that it was
again time to attempt <em>something</em> stupid, this time migrating my whole digital
life to OneDrive, the cloud file synchronization tool made by Microsoft, our
erstwhile sworn enemy who later turned out to be pretty cool after all.</p>
<p>My main reason this time was again cost, and reducing the number of
subscriptions and cloud systems we use. (we already have OneDrive as part of
the incredibly reasonably priced Microsoft 365 family)</p>
<p>About two weeks ago I managed to copy all of my files (more than 500 thousand
files totalling over 200GB) from Dropbox to OneDrive over a few days, using the
amazing rclone tool, via my Hetzner VPS in Germany.</p>
<p>After some initial hiccups as the various OneDrive clients had to catch up to
the deluge of new files that were coming in, this setup has been working pretty
well!</p>
<p>On each of my Windows development machines (2 active, 1 semi-active) I have
unison running in watch mode under tmux syncing only the subset of the folders
that I need to be on WSL2, namely source code and my pkb4000 notes
database. (the same notes database containing the month file that houses this
blog post draft &ndash; every time I hit <code>C-x C-s</code>, the Emacs hotkey for save, this
file is synced from WSL to the host drive by Unison, and then from there to the
OneDrive cloud)</p>
<p>I also have the OneDrive client on my M1 MBA where it uses more ram than
Dropbox, but where its RAM for some reason gets compressed much more readily
than the Dropbox client.</p>
<p>While the syncing is not as fast as dropbox (in terms of picking up changes and
zapping them to the cloud and to other machines), it&rsquo;s entirely
serviceable. unison is blindingly fast for its part of the job.</p>
<p>As an added bonus, this enabled me to exclude <code>node_modules</code> FOREVER in the
default unison profile that I use.</p>
<p>Note that you can configure OneDrive to exclude files BY WILDCARD (see <a href="https://superuser.com/a/1662761/130835">this
superuser.com answer</a>), something that even the great Dropbox has no way of
doing.</p>
<h3 id="yes-you-can-keep-your-checked-out-source-code-in-dropbox-or-onedrive">Yes, you CAN keep your checked-out source code in Dropbox or OneDrive!</h3>
<p>Finally, hereby I also officially announce that: Why yes, I do keep <em>all</em> of my
checked out source code projects in OneDrive. Previously, I did the same for
years and years in Dropbox.</p>
<p>I have very good reasons for doing this.</p>
<p>My tweet below and the blog post that I link explain some of these reasons:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Every time someone asks about storing git repos in <a href="https://twitter.com/Dropbox?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Dropbox</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/onedrive?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@onedrive</a> someone asks &quot;why?! because git already does that!&quot; - well no, it doesn&#39;t instantaneously sync all your work so that you can change workstations on a whim! <a href="https://twitter.com/Lexisomes?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Lexisomes</a> explains: <a href="https://t.co/UCiNcAGCal">https://t.co/UCiNcAGCal</a></p>&mdash; charlbotha dot com dot net dot org (@cvoxel) <a href="https://twitter.com/cvoxel/status/1582682819037626368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 19, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>&hellip; and here I recently came out about this issue on reddit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have been hosting all of my source code in dropbox AND pushing to various git
repos for years and years now, with nary a hitch. For the past few weeks, I
have been trying OneDrive, and so far it&rsquo;s been going well.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to explain to people over the years that there are good
reasons for doing so, in my case primarily the fact that I work on the same
projects on various machines and laptops, and I prefer NOT abusing git commits
for manual syncing</p>
<p>Furthermore, I&rsquo;m often working on a number of repos, and having to commit all
of them just to switch ot my laptop does not make any sense.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next time someone claims that this is what git is for, please send them to
me, because it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<h2 id="from-the-departments-of-physics-and-breakfast">From the Departments of Physics and Breakfast</h2>
<p>I recently learned about the official names of the third to sixth derivates of
position, from <a href="https://twitter.com/JimPfaendtner/status/1588987738426314752">Twitter of all places</a>.</p>
<p>(Over the years, I&rsquo;ve actually learned quite a lot from there, but who knows
how we&rsquo;ll look back at it in a few years time.)</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth,_fifth,_and_sixth_derivatives_of_position">Wikipedia confirms</a> that indeed after the pretty unsurprisingly named first and
second derivatives, namely <em>velocity</em> and <em>acceleration</em>, things started getting just a
little bit weird, but understandable, with <em>jerk</em> for the third, and <em>snap</em> or <em>jounce</em> for the
fourth, but then the clown gloves came off with <strong><em>snap</em></strong>, <strong><em>crackle</em></strong> and <strong><em>pop</em></strong> for the
fourth to the sixth derivatives!</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that just marvelous?!</p>
<p>I really wanted to reproduce the list here using the built-in \(\KaTeX\) support
in this blog, and so I fell down a small rabbit-hole because \(\KaTeX\), while
amazing and fast, does not have <code>eqnarray</code>, and its <code>aligned</code> environment needs
some help with vertical spacing (<code>\\[1.5ex]</code> at the end of every line to give it
a bit of an extra nudge).</p>
<p>Secondly, I had to update my modification of the <a href="https://github.com/carsonip/hugo-theme-minos">hugo-minos theme</a> so that it
uses the latest version of \(\KaTeX\), and so that I could add that very <code>aligned</code>
environment to its default list of <a href="https://katex.org/docs/autorender.html#api">delimiters via the optional <code>options</code>
argument to <code>renderMathInElement()</code></a>.</p>
<p>Finally, while Org-mode and the brilliant ox-hugo usually automatically pass
<a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/LaTeX-fragments.html">\(\LaTeX\) fragments</a> through to Hugo, in this case I had to wrap it in an <code>HTML</code>
export block and manually specify the correct number (four) of slashes, as it was
automatically transforming <code>\\[1.5ex]</code> into <code>\\\[1.5ex]</code> (note the three slashes
instead of four, whilst without the <code>[...]</code> it correctly generates four).</p>
<p>Anyways, after all that, you get these nicely rendered equations:</p>
<p>\begin{aligned}
\bm{r} &amp;= \operatorname{position}\\[1.5ex]
\frac{d\bm{r}}{dt} &amp;= \operatorname{velocity}\\[1.5ex]
\frac{d^2\bm{r}}{dt^2} &amp;= \operatorname{acceleration}\\[1.5ex]
\frac{d^3\bm{r}}{dt^3} &amp;= \operatorname{jerk}\\[1.5ex]
\frac{d^4\bm{r}}{dt^4} &amp;= \operatorname{snap}\\[1.5ex]
\frac{d^5\bm{r}}{dt^5} &amp;= \operatorname{crackle}\\[1.5ex]
\frac{d^6\bm{r}}{dt^6} &amp;= \operatorname{pop}
\end{aligned}</p>
<p>Wow, blogging with Org-mode and Hugo sure is easy! :)</p>
<p>P.S. You might remember that it was also a <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/news-blog/how-a-fake-word-from-the-simpsons-e/">Physics paper that helped
main-streaming the word <em>embiggen</em></a> from The Simpsons right into our
dictionaries.</p>

<p>This is the year of me struggling to make the time and the energy to write
these posts. Between work (it&rsquo;s never been this truly busy before), family
(teenagers man) and other important activities, this previously
straight-forward endeavour has become really challenging.</p>
<p>I currently have no cunning plans to remedy this issue, except to keep on
trying.</p>
<p>Anyways, my main goal with this post below morphed from &ldquo;try to write a good
post&rdquo; to &ldquo;<em>any</em> post is better than no post&rdquo;, and so it is entirely possible that
you&rsquo;ll notice some unevenness.</p>
<h2 id="wilderness-energy">Wilderness Energy</h2>
<p>So after a number of paragraphs complaining about how little free time I have
at my disposal, I shall now briefly talk about our October family break-away to
the East coast!</p>
<p>As we often do, we decided to break the road-trip in two, staying for the night
in Wilderness, literally one of my favourite places on the planet.</p>
<p>As we don&rsquo;t often do, this time we stayed an extra night because the weather,
and that balmy Wilderness energy (it sounds like a pretty hip caffeinated
drink) were simply too amazing to pass up.</p>
<p>During our surprise extra day:</p>
<ul>
<li>I ran the Waterside dirt road next to the Serpentine river, in the direction of
Hoekwil. I love running dirt roads, and this one is high up on the list.</li>
<li>We (6 famjam + 1 friend) did the canoe trip at Kaaimanskloof, something that
we&rsquo;ve always dreamed about, to the waterfall, to the train bridge and later
up the river all the way to the bend right below the Map of Africa lookout,
far up above. I shared a canoe with my most favourite middle child in the
world, aka GOU #2. (We also won the race back, even beating out the far more
energetic canoe powered by GOU #1 and her friend, by applying a certain
degree of crystallized-intelligence-guided strategy.)</li>
<li>We squeezed in a beach day.</li>
<li>We went up to Map of Africa to enjoy the brilliant sunset.</li>
</ul>
<p>After all of that I was a bit worried that we had set the pace of the whole
week, the sustaining of which I would probably not have survived.</p>
<p>Fortunately the continuation of our vacation in St Francis was, whilst <em>quite</em>
active, an energetically more sustainable affair, consisting of balmy weather,
family beach days, and zen-inducing sunsets.</p>
<p>Personally, I will <em>remember</em> this week as a great example of How To Holiday.</p>

<h2 id="goldilocks-water-for-your-moka-pot">Goldilocks water for your Moka pot</h2>
<p>At home, we rely on our <a href="/2022/09/25/weekly-head-voices-246-call-up-your-friends/#coffee-machine-reincarnation">trusty (new) Saeco bean-to-cup</a> machine to keep us
continously and quite fully coffee-nated.</p>
<p>However, because there is no space for Saeco on our travels, we require a
mobile, preferably compact, coffee production modality.</p>
<p>This used to be the giant coffee syringe, also known as Aeropress, which I
wrote about in <a href="/2014/07/22/weekly-head-voices-78-aeroimpressed/">WHV #78, back in 2014</a>.</p>
<p>It makes really great tasting coffee, but it can feel a little clinical.</p>
<p>More recently, as we became older (a tenacious process that never seems to stop
until the end, I am told) and our appreciation for the slower, more deliberate
rituals of life grew, we decided to switch to a Bialetti Moka pot instead.</p>
<p>You would probably recognise it. It&rsquo;s that distinctive little aluminium pot
with the octagonal base and the friendly picture on the side.</p>
<p>Instead of the one minute stir, one minute push through of the Aeropress, this
artifact sits there on its hob for about five minutes when it magically fills
up with lovely espresso.</p>
<p>(Of course it&rsquo;s not magic, it&rsquo;s just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moka_pot">Mr Alfonso Bialetti&rsquo;s brilliant
engineering from 1933</a>!)</p>
<p>Here is our Moka pot, this time posing in <a href="/tags/stilbaai/">Stilbaai</a>, another one of my favourite
vacation destinations:</p>

<p>More recently, I chatted with friend PH at work about the ideal starting
temperature for the fresh water in one&rsquo;s Moka.</p>
<p>I had naively always preferred to start with cold water, to emulate the camping
situation, but work-friend explained that he had understood warm water to be
better for the taste.</p>
<p>I had never considered this before. Doh!</p>
<p>(Later I learned from mutual friend SvdW that they had in fact previously
studied Moka pot temperature in detail during a work trip, an experience
perhaps partially forgotten by friend PH.)</p>
<p>Serendipitously, during a meeting later that afternoon with colleagues from the
US, one of our collaborators, sporting a pretty relevant scientific background,
explained that <em>he</em> had understood (in Fahrenheit, we had to translate) that 60
°C resulted in the best coffee extraction.</p>
<p>This obviously piqued my curiousity, quite intensely, and so I went searching
that evening&hellip;</p>
<p>Imagine my delight when I ran into <a href="http://www.msc.univ-paris-diderot.fr/~phyexp/uploads/Moka/article1.pdf"><em>The physics of a stove-top espresso
machine</em></a>, a 2008 scientific article by Dr Warren D. King in the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1119/1.2870524"><em>American
Journal of Physics</em>, vol. 76, no. 6, pp. 558–565</a>, in which he documents his
mathematical modeling and experiments showing that the optimal starting
temperature for the water in a Moka pot is in fact 70 °C!</p>
<p>The short version of the story is that this will result in most of the water
going through the coffee grounds, when extraction takes place, at about 95
°C, which results in the most  flavour.</p>
<p>If you start with cold water, extraction will happen at 70 °C, which is
too low, and if you start with hot water, it will go through the grounds at too
high a temperature, resulting in bitter coffee.</p>
<h2 id="take-a-picture-with-your-mind">Take a picture with your mind</h2>
<!-- The title of this section is due to friend PK. You have to say it in his voice, "take a picture with your miiii-iiiiind!" -->
<p>Back in <a href="/2022/05/23/weekly-head-voices-242-multiplicity-of-me/#multiplicity-of-you">WHV #242 I talked about the remembering (narrating) self, and the
experiencing self</a>. (Please read that section if you have not yet. In fact, I
think that the whole of WHV #242 could be worth your time.)</p>
<p>Kahnemann&rsquo;s poignant quote bears repeating here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Odd as it may seem, I am my remembering self, and the experiencing self, who
does my living, is like a stranger to me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just the other day, in the middle of a perfect run on the beach, with a breeze
that was just <em>so</em>, the sun all golden and ready to set, and with my bare feet
connecting with the sand and the earth beneath it, it felt like a full sensory
connect, experiencing self for once fully in control.</p>
<p>It was perfect, until I felt this superficially pretty reasonable urge to take
a photo, just a little something to remember the perfect moment by&hellip;</p>
<p>At that instant, I saw it for what it was &ndash; sneaky, remembering self
attempting to hijack the moment, and take it away from experiencing self, the
one who at that moment was generating by far the most positive energy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We wants it, we needs it. Must have the precious. They stole it from us. Sneaky
little hobbitses. Wicked, tricksy, false! &ndash; JRR Tolkien</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The desire to remember the perfect moment is understandable, but there is a
cost: The moment itself.</p>
<p>Resist the urge.</p>
<p>Love,<br />
Remembering Self</p>

<p>The later I get, the more difficult it becomes to put these things out.</p>
<p>Although not that many people read them, it feels like expectations increase
over time, and thus the barrier continues getting higher and higher.</p>
<p>Contrary to what it might sound like, I love doing what I&rsquo;m doing right now.</p>
<p>However, sometimes I wish to return to less complicated times, when writing a
post was a relaxed Sunday morning affair.</p>
<p>Changing space and time is not going to happen, and so, as is often the case, <em>I</em>
am the one who will have to change.</p>
<p>On the immediate term, it means that this post is even more all over the place
than normal. I would tell you to skip it, but then you might miss the bits at
the end.</p>
<p>On the slightly longer term, I would like to try to write a few WHV sentences
every day, apart from my normal daily notes, to see if that could mitigate the
writing gradient build-up.</p>
<p><em>On y va!</em></p>
<h2 id="birthday-messages">Birthday messages</h2>
<p>During the past weeks, I completed another orbit around the sun, of course only
as a (hopefully sufficiently erudite) planetary hitchhiker.</p>
<p>On the day, many friends sent me so many lovely messages over various
communication channels.</p>
<p>In some cases, people had clearly made use of the opportunity to include
additional and quite specific warm wishes.</p>
<p>Every year, I am again surprised by how <em>much</em> I appreciate these gifts.</p>
<p>This is my reminder to me, and to anyone else who might need to hear it: Write
sweet birthday wishes. In fact, make use of any such excuse to connect with
people.</p>
<p>P.S. Back in 2015, <a href="/2015/06/28/weekly-head-voices-93-a-thank-you-note/">I mentioned the sage advice of David Sedaris</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Write thank you notes.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="coffee-machine-reincarnation">Coffee machine reincarnation</h2>
<p>Some of you might remember when it arrived, and some of you have even tasted of
its dark and delicious produce over the years.</p>
<p>I am of course referring the beautiful mechanical beast that is our Saeco
Incanto Cappuccino, the Italian bean-to-cup machine <a href="/2007/04/08/infinite-espressos/">that came into our lives
fifteen years ago</a> and since then has only brought us pleasure, and structure,
and so much focus.</p>
<p>Sadly, it recently started tripping the RCD, aka residual current device, aka
the ECB, aka the earth leakage breaker, aka the GFCI if you&rsquo;re in the US.</p>
<p>This generally happens after the first cup, at the second solenoid tap (of
three), between the grinding and the pouring of the coffee.</p>
<p>This means that somewhere in the machine a live wire  has come into contact with
the chassis. The RCD measures this as a (small) current difference (the earth
leakage) between live and neutral and isolates that circuit to prevent any
humans from being electrocuted.</p>
<p>I took it in for repairs, and although it came back all nice and shiny with new
o-rings everywhere, the earth leakage was not remedied.</p>
<p>We took this as a sign that it was finally time to invest in a new bean-to-cup
machine, and so we did&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip; into a brand new Saeco, this time the <a href="https://www.philips.co.za/c-p/HD8927_01/picobaristo-super-automatic-espresso-machine">Saeco PicoBaristo</a>.</p>
<p>While the old machine was the epitome of purpose-built simplicity, the new one
does have <em>significantly</em> more buttons and lights.</p>
<p>One improvement that I can really appreciate, is the fact that the new machine
is able to complete a coffee that is interrupted by the water reservoir
empyting mid-process.</p>
<p>Whatever the case may be, it is <em>quite</em> capable of converting beans into tasty
coffee at sufficient speed with just the right amount of ritual, and that was
the point.</p>
<h2 id="the-world-in-their-eyes">The world in their eyes</h2>
<p>Thanks to friends visiting us from NL (for the first time), we had the
privilege of spending some time with them (re-)exploring our surroundings.</p>
<p>Thanks to their abundance of vacation energy (keeping up even for the while
that we did was challenging) we squeezed in a number of activities (themes:
hikes, restaurants and fine wine), two of which I would like to mention here:</p>
<p>We had an absolutely fabulous Sunday lunch adventure at <a href="https://www.creationwines.com/">Creation Wines</a> on the
Hemel-en-Aarde ridge.</p>
<p>This lunch adventure consisted of various small and large dishes combined with
the tasting of various Creation wines, all of this coordinated by Jack, our amazing
sommelier and story-teller for the afternoon.</p>
<p>Combined with the frankly brilliant view of the vineyard-covered mountain, this
was definitely one of those <a href="/2022/02/03/weekly-head-voices-237-dont-step-over-the-thing/#i-don-t-want-to-step-over-the-thing">perfect present moment <em>things</em> deserving all of
one&rsquo;s attention</a>.</p>
<p>In order to compensate for our sins on the Sunday, on Monday we hiked up to the
top of Table Mountain via Platteklip Gorge. It was quite a bit slower than <a href="/2017/01/20/weekly-head-voices-114-so-you-know-what-i-did-last-summer/#getting-high">my
previous Platties adventure in 2017</a>, but it was good fun nonetheless.</p>
<p>However, now I do feel obliged to go up again in the not too distant future,
but this time in speed mode in order to calibrate my memory of my 2017
performance.</p>
<p>More generally speaking, spending time with friends in tourist mode is a great
way to maintain one&rsquo;s gratitude for this amazing place.</p>

<h3 id="meet-your-heroes">Meet your heroes</h3>
<p>Lex Fridman made a 5 hour+ long <a href="https://lexfridman.com/john-carmack/">podcast with John Carmack</a>.</p>
<p>As is the case for many programming nerds, Carmack has been a hero of mine
since the day I learned of his existence. Also like many nerds of my era, I
spent many hours first with Commander , and later with Wolfenstein, Doom and
Quake.</p>
<p>Although John Romero certainly deserves much of the credit for these culture
changing projects, Carmack was and probably still is one of the best
programmers on the planet.</p>
<p>Anyways, it was great to hear that he sounds like a very decent human as well.</p>
<p>You should probably listen to the podcast (haha), but I would like to single
out here how Carmack explained that they were uniquely positioned when starting
on Commander Keen, in terms of the hundreds (thousands?) of hours of practice
they had had building multiple games per year for Softdisk.</p>
<p>In other words, while they were brilliant, Carmack attributes a great deal of
their break-through success to plain old hard work.</p>
<p>(See <a href="/2018/03/11/weekly-head-voices-135-its-all-rainbows-and-unicorns-no-really/#the-carmack-productivity-method-cpm">WHV #135</a> for a previous bit about Carmack&rsquo;s productivity.)</p>
<h3 id="call-up-your-friends">Call up your friends</h3>
<p>In an interview between Sam Harris and Oscar Burkeman (he of <a href="/2022/01/23/the-2021-to-2022-transition-post/#reading">the 4000 weeks
book, winner of the <em>WHV non-fiction book of 2021 Award</em></a> , and of <a href="/2021/08/20/weekly-head-voices-230-follow-your-blisters/#know-how-to-put-down-your-work">the power of
being able to put down your work</a>), Sam remarks so astutely that we have become
so caught up in the importance of the illusion of control of one&rsquo;s time, that
we have stopped calling up our friends.</p>
<p>Instead, you send a message with something like &ldquo;hey, let me know when you have
a few minutes for a phone call&rdquo;&hellip;</p>
<p>Now your friend either sees this much later, or sees it when you send it, and
then has to cogitate about if and when they could maybe fit you in somewhere
later in the day.</p>
<p>Not so long ago, you could just call up your friend, all serendipitous, and all
present-momenty, because what could be truly more important than spending a few
minutes connecting with your friend and/or loved one, and maybe having the
opportunity to just let them know that you&rsquo;re there for them?</p>
<p>If they are really unable to take your call, they won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>However, the subtle improvement here is that everyone sometimes needs a tiny
bit of a nudge to do the right thing and connect with a brother or sister.</p>
<p>Be the nudge. Accept the nudge. Call up your friends!</p>

<p>However, as they say, a badly written but <em>published</em> blog post is miles better

<p>I have replaced Docker Desktop for Windows with <a href="https://rancherdesktop.io/">Rancher Desktop</a>, with the
dockerd runtime, on two of my Windows development machines.</p>
<p>Although you have to create some WSL symlinks manually, configure RD&rsquo;s
<code>docker-credential-wincred.exe</code> (if you&rsquo;re using private container registries)
and manually install zsh completions, the end-result is a great and
fully-functional replacement for my use-case of <a href="https://containers.dev/">devcontainers</a> everywhere.</p>
<p>Please let me know if you need more detail about the RD config.</p>
<p>P.S. It might come as a shock to some readers, not to mention me of 10 years
ago, that I have not only one, but two Windows workstations. My excuse is:

<h3 id="notes-on-locally-upgrading-the-firmware-of-the-gw5048d-es-inverter">Notes on locally upgrading the firmware of the GW5048D-ES inverter</h3>
<p>There is a Goodwe GW5048D-ES 4.6 kVA inverter at the heart of the solar system powering my house.</p>
<p>I love it, because it&rsquo;s reliable, and just does the work 99.7% of the time.</p>
<p>However, because that 0.3% manifested recently (settings were partially
scrambled, resulting in a few minutes of darkness during a load shedding
session; could have been the Home Assistant Goodwe integration; more acutely,
its wifi access point, needed for configuration, recently disappeared) and the
OTA firmware I requested via Goodwe support failed, probably due to firmware
being a bit old already, I had to attempt a local firmware upgrade, with a USB
cable, like <a href="/2019/07/17/weekly-head-voices-173-i-know/#bullet-list-of-miscellany-blom">I last did three years ago</a> (rocky road then).</p>
<p>Well, although my inverter is now sporting firmware version 2424G, the upgrade
definitety went on roads of the more rocky variety.</p>
<p>Here are some tips to help you if you&rsquo;re in the same boat:</p>
<ul>
<li>Follow the instructions to the letter:
<ul>
<li>Remove all power sources except for a single DC source. I disconnected grid
and solar panels, keeping only the batteries connected which were close to
full.</li>
<li>Remove the wifi module: 4 screws, and then carefully remove the plastic
connector.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Get a straight USB-A male to USB-A male cable. None of my USB-C to USB-A
cables, or my various Frankensteined extensions, could connect (as reported
by EzFlash.</li>
</ul>
<p>In my case, the EzFlash upgrade worked (two bin files), but then right after
that the DataSend failed.</p>
<p>I retried DataSend multiple times, but finally lost connection to the
inverter&rsquo;s USB port.</p>
<p>After I put everything back together (having resolved to contact support to
help troubleshoot), the inverter&rsquo;s access point magically appeared, at which
point I could connect to see that everything was functioning, and inverter
reported firmware version as 2424G.</p>
<p>I did contact Goodwe to ask about the implications of DataSend
failing. Although I&rsquo;m happy with their service, I would have appreciated a bit
more detail.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve summarised our email thread below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I asked: &ldquo;When I did the upgrade, the DataSend file did not go through at
all. Could you help me understand how the upgrade is OK if I only did the
EzFlash stage, and NOT the DataSend phase?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They answered: &ldquo;Do note that the datasend file is only for use when updating
the Armware. When updating firmware its only the EZflash and master bin file
that is use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I asked: &ldquo;What is the Armware for then? Why is it not necessary to upgrade
it, although the upgrade manual gives instructions to upgrade it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon which they replied: &ldquo;You ARM is already updated that is why i advised not
to worry about it. There isn&rsquo;t anything technical that i can share on this. The
arm as we know normally works with communication with the batteries.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="school-s-anti-wikipedia-stance-leads-to-lessons-and-pi-hole">School&rsquo;s anti-wikipedia stance leads to lessons and Pi-hole</h2>
<p>Last week, GOU #2 tried to print a pretty nasty, infinite-scroll, ad-infested
site with stolen wikipedia content because her school has a far too simplistic
and strict rule <em>against</em> using wikipedia for school work.</p>
<p>I then proceeded to:</p>
<ol>
<li>have a long talk with her about computers not doing what you intend, but
rather exactly what you tell them to,</li>
<li>Do some research and realise to my shock that this anti-wikipedia stance
seems to be a world-wide teacher thing;</li>
<li>Write a long but friendly email to the teacher explaining that it&rsquo;s a lot
more nuanced, and could I please help them to understand the nuances so that
our kids get better at filtering information rather than just blindly
avoiding wikipedia and</li>
<li>At long last get around to installing <a href="https://pi-hole.net/">Pi-hole</a> on this old linux laptop (via
docker-compose) and sending all DNS requests its way (via my main router&rsquo;s
DHCP service), all-in-all quite a painless process!</li>
</ol>
<p>What this means is that all devices in my household (and there&rsquo;s quite a number
of them) get all of their ads blocked automatically.</p>

<h2 id="this-too-shall-pass">This too shall pass</h2>
<p>On Saturday July 30, the date of the final interschools clash between Paarl
Boys&rsquo; High School (my alma mater) and its arch-opponent Paarl Gimnasium, I had
the privilege of attending the 30th (!!) anniversary of my matriculation year,
along with about 50 class mates.</p>
<p>As a bit of context, back then I operated probably at the lowest end of the
popularity scale, mostly because of my personality. Not that it&rsquo;s that
important anymore, but I think that I would probably have irritated myself (in
both ways) to quite an extent.</p>
<p>As if that was not enough, I had even <em>less</em> ball sense then than I do now.</p>
<p>In spite of all that, the reunion was a sublime and deeply enjoyable affair.</p>
<p>It was so great connecting again with the human journeyers I had in many cases
last seen right before we would all set off on the start of adulthood.</p>
<p>Back then, we were all bright-eyed, hot-headed, full of plans and with heads
full of luscious hair.</p>
<p>Now there was substantially less hair, many hard lessons learned, but wisdom,
and sometimes peace, in the eyes.</p>
<p>To me it really felt as if everyone there had this collective, positive
realisation of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s OK.</p>
<p>We know better what&rsquo;s truly important, and it&rsquo;s not what we believed back then.</p>
<p>All of this? Let us enjoy it without complication.</p>
<p>Like everything before it, this too shall pass.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps I am over-projecting.</p>
<p>Whatever the case may be, the enjoyment was as real as could be.</p>
<p>Thank you Boys High&rsquo; Class of &lsquo;92!</p>

<h2 id="winter-don-t-call-us-we-ll-call-you">Winter, don&rsquo;t call us, we&rsquo;ll call you</h2>
<p>Shortly after the start of this period, June 21 to be exact, I was frankly and
quite pleasantly surprised by the Southern Hemisphere winter solstice.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/sun/south-AFRICA/cape-town">This handy Time and Date website</a> has more details, including but not limited
to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The June solstice (winter solstice) in Cape Town is at 11:13 on Tuesday, 21
June 2022. In terms of daylight, this day is 4 hours, 32 minutes shorter than
the December solstice. In locations south of the equator, the shortest day of
the year is around this date.</p>
<p>The earliest sunset is on 12 June. The latest sunrise is on 29 June or 30 June.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of you <a href="/2021/06/16/weekly-head-voices-226-stress-practice/#solstice-tipping-point-is-coming">might remember</a> that this is an important point in the year for me,
the moment when I can see the big light, namely summer, at the end of the
tunnel.</p>
<h2 id="projections">Projections</h2>
<p>I recently finished reading the book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/55411738-projections"><em>Projections: A Story of Human Emotions</em>
by Karl Deisseroth</a>.</p>
<p>As a layperson, I found this psychiatrist and world-changing scientist&rsquo;s view
of the world, and especially of the psyches of his patients, absolutely
fascinating.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Deisseroth">Deisseroth</a> writes about several different types of psychiatric disorders, but
does so via specific but (probably) fictional patients who embody the important
aspects of the disorder in question.</p>
<p>He also writes about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optogenetics">Optogenetics</a>.</p>
<p>Optogenetics is a technique, invented by Deisseroth, for controlling neurons
with lasers, <em>in vivo</em>.</p>
<p>More specifically, by inserting specific genes from algae, neurons can be
modified to activate when struck by light.</p>
<p>Using this technique, researchers are able to activate very specific subsets of
neurons in mice brains, making the mice feel anxious for example, or
comfortable, or any of the different neural components making up these mental
states.</p>
<p>From the Wikpedia artictle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In systems neuroscience, the ability to control the activity of a genetically
defined set of neurons has been used to understand their contribution to
decision making, learning, fear memory, mating, addiction, feeding, and
locomotion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The use of this technique has already contributed significantly to our
fundamental understanding of the brain, and the first steps have been taken
towards using it in therapy.</p>
<p>Judging by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optogenetics#Awards">the list of awards</a>, the scientific world has really noticed the
value of this work.</p>
<p>Personally, I am optimistic that there&rsquo;s much more to come.</p>
<p>P.S. Close to the end of <a href="https://lexfridman.com/karl-deisseroth/">the Lex Fridman podcast with Deisseroth</a>, Deisseroth
mentioned that he really doubts whether he has done enough&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="batting-for-biyamiti">Batting for Biyamiti</h2>
<p>I am Bat-Fan.</p>
<p>No really, I appreciate bats. (and puns)</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re little flying mammals who see and navigate the world <em>expertly</em> using
echolocation (just imagine what that <em>feels</em> like?!) . They eat large numbers of
insects, including a <a href="https://news.wisc.edu/study-bolsters-bats-reputation-as-mosquito-devourers/">debatable</a> number of mosquitoes (I did not know about the
debate until right now).</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s not to like?</p>
<p>However, during our recent freshly reinstated yearly <a href="/2019/06/30/weekly-head-voices-172-abc/">KNP break</a>, we enjoyed
fantastic summer weather (it&rsquo;s winter down here, but that&rsquo;s Mpumalanga for
you), we spent one night in Biyamiti with a pretty active bat in the room.</p>
<p>As we went to sleep, we thought that it would probably be ok.</p>
<p>It was not.</p>
<p>In addition to the bat expertly dropping something wet in my eye (your guess is
as good as mine), during parts of the night it started doing fly-bys so close
to our faces that we could feel the discrete wind gusts caused by the flapping
of its little wings.</p>
<p>On the one hand I was quite impressed by its sheer <em>mammalian</em> skill, but on
the other we just really wanted to sleep.</p>
<p>We decided that the price of a few extra insects in the room was worth it, and
so we opened the mesh.</p>
<p>Our bat friend, in spite of apparently having built a little nest in the nook
right up in the apex of the roof, fortunately obliged by exiting to perform the
rest of its manouevres outside in the night.</p>

This WHV covers the multiple weeks from Monday May 23 to Sunday June 19, 2022.

I hope to say something about that a bit further down.

<h2 id="a-drop-in-the-bucket-is-a-drop-in-the-bucket">A drop in the bucket is a drop in the bucket</h2>
<p>After taking a critical look at my discord subscription (I&rsquo;m too old for
animated emojis anyways), I decided to cancel that, and rather switch to
(small) monthly subscriptions to two services I find really important: <a href="/2016/01/02/when-we-can-lets-use-signal-instead-of-whatsapp/">Signal</a>
(the private messaging app; I activated the sub via Apple) and <a href="https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Ways_to_Give">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<p>#feelsgoodman</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that I have piles of cash to give away every month (come back in 6
months, hopefully that mythical ship will have come in), but I learned at a
recent course on the topic that it is possible, and even prudent, to review
critically and design with intent one&rsquo;s strategy of giving.</p>
<p>What do you find important, and which organizations appear to be applying their
resources effectively towards the furthering of their (and your) principles?</p>
<p>In that same vein, I subscribe (at the cheapest tier until ship comes in, see
above) to one of the <a href="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/">better local news sources</a>, although their articles are
available for free online. We live in a society&hellip; where functional and honest
journalism is crucially important.</p>
<h2 id="tip-the-tailscale">tip the tailscale</h2>
<p>Some time back, a friend from work suggested tailscale as a tool to connect
computers and devices, separated by firewalls, into a virtual private network</p>
<p>My brain helpfully surfaced this information about three weeks back when I
wondered if there was a less painful way to connect to my home network from
work via the OpenVPN server on my home router.</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that there&rsquo;s a <em>delightfully smooth</em> way to connect the
devices that you own together into a secure network, no matter behind which
firewalls they might be hiding.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called <a href="https://tailscale.com/">tailscale</a>.</p>
<p>Within five minutes (literally) I had five of my devices hooked up, and
suddenly I was able to make point-to-point wireguard connections from anywhere
to anywhere, often via two firewalls, without having to click any buttons.</p>
<p>Each device is automatically assigned a &ldquo;static&rdquo; <code>100.*.*.*</code> IP number, and
hostnames can even be setup via tailscale MagicDNS, which is currently the
switching of a single toggle.</p>
<h2 id="typescript-with-emacs-and-tree-sitter">TypeScript with Emacs and tree-sitter</h2>
<p>In spite of the fact that I mostly use Visual Studio Code for my programming
these days (Emacs is for everything else), a question on reddit&rsquo;s <code>/r/emacs</code>
caused me to go down the Emacs-TypeScript-and-tree-sitter rabbit-hole.</p>
<p>I wrote up most of the results of this adventure a vxlabs post titled
<a href="https://vxlabs.com/2022/06/12/typescript-development-with-emacs-tree-sitter-and-lsp-in-2022/">TypeScript development with Emacs, tree-sitter and LSP in 2022</a>.</p>
<p>After years of hearing its name mentioned, this was my first real contact with
tree-sitter, which turns out to be a fascinating recent development in
interactive source code parsing.</p>
<p>Thanks to tree-sitter, which was developed by the Atom editor team at GitHub,
and the combination of LSP and Microsoft&rsquo;s typescript compiler, Emacs (just
like other open source editors), gets access to state-of-the-art code
intelligence.</p>
<h2 id="when-the-going-gets-tough-double-down-on-the-side-projects">When the going gets tough, double-down on the side-projects</h2>
<p>If anything, this is a note to myself, but maybe also to you.</p>
<p>As evidenced by the lateness of this post and the one before it, the weekly
head voices had to take a backseat to other priorities.</p>
<p>However, writing posts on this here blog is one of <a href="/2022/05/23/weekly-head-voices-242-multiplicity-of-me/#learning-at-the-burning">my &ldquo;show up to every day&rdquo;
things</a>, and so the fact that my frequency is currently reduced probably has
nothing to do with <a href="/2022/03/01/weekly-head-voices-239-embarrassing-finitude/#the-rickety-raft-of-life-directions-and-priorities">the general rickety raft of shifting life directions and
priorities</a>, but is indeed due to more urgent work sneakily taking precedence.</p>
<p>I have deliberately chosen the word &ldquo;sneakily&rdquo;, because when I start actually
paying attention (an activity the frequency of which is ironically also reduced
due to above-mentioned business), I realise that under these circumstances it
becomes even more important to buckle down and make time for the side-projects.</p>
<p>I could waste time on YouTube and reddit, or I could apply some intent and
create something interesting that is deliberately outside the broad umbrella of
work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t like work (I love it), but rather spending that
carved-out time on side-projects is invigorating, and boosts creativity.</p>
<p>P.S. I like YouTube too, but it&rsquo;s time:leisure ratio (I recently coined that
term in a discussion with GOU#1 about her instagram usage) is not great.</p>
<h2 id="part-time--role--model">Part-time (role-)model</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve discussed the following with a small number of friends (some of them my
mentors; haha who am I kidding, they&rsquo;re all my mentors) over the years, so it
must be correct.</p>
<p>What I have learned over time, is that all of us are role models for fellow
humans at various (hopefully high) points in time, but we won&rsquo;t know when and
we often won&rsquo;t know for whom.</p>
<p>This knowledge has more than one important implication.</p>
<p>Firstly, we can never stop trying to be good humans, because we don&rsquo;t know who
might be depending on us at that moment.</p>
<p>This is reminiscent <a href="/2008/11/17/what-i-did-this-err-summer/">one of my favourite quotes, this one by Plato</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Secondly, we will always have those ups and those downs, and often it will feel
like the ratio is hopelessly in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>I have explained to my children (my most important mentees, also the ones that
seem to pay the least attention) that athough I often fail, I will always keep
on trying.</p>
<p>Finally, even my own amazing mentors are humans who have ups and downs.</p>
<p>I love them for who they are, but I remember them at their best.</p>

<h2 id="learning-at-the-burning">Learning at the Burning</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s an unwritten rule that you should not make any life decisions for at
least three weeks after the (Afrika)Burn.</p>
<p>Apparently people have, inspired by the sometimes weird experiences of the
event, made some major but unfortunately quite regrettable decisions in its
afterglow.</p>
<p>Anyways, I did not come back with anything like that.</p>
<p>Without sounding (too much) like Zaphod eating the fairy cake powering the
Total Perspective Vortex and walking away pretty much unscathed, through the
week&rsquo;s ups (mostly) and downs I learned a bunch, and I did come back with some
internal changes, but they were at their most extreme a strong reminder (kick
in the butt might even be appropriate) of a partially buried perspective or
two.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is now exactly three weeks after the thing, and although that
dusty afterglow has definitely waned, it feels like I&rsquo;ve just merged back into
reality without any major incidents, just a slight tweak (or gentle kick in the
butt) here and there, for the better.</p>
<p>(Because inquiring minds might want to know, yes, we again brought the
BURNIVERSITY. We&rsquo;re probably one of the smallest theme camps, but we were
intense, and it feels like our interactions were too.)</p>
<p>Anyways, here are some completely random words, some of them loosely based (or
not at all, or something in between) on a recent conversation with friend PK,
and some of them from friend DW:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/2021/07/27/weekly-head-voices-229-staycation-perma-station/#perma-the-five-building-blocks-of-well-being">PERMA</a> is a good framework for your well-being, and that of your loved ones:
<ol>
<li>Positive Emotion</li>
<li>Engagement</li>
<li>Relationships</li>
<li>Meaning</li>
<li>Accomplishment</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>That thing you&rsquo;re stressing about is most probably not worth such a high
personal cost, and health-risk.</li>
<li>Just do the work.</li>
<li><a href="https://typesense.org/blog/the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-just-showing-up-everyday/">Just showing up every day is a super power</a>. Pick your thing(s), show up to

<li>Chopping onions is the physical manifestation of your love for the people for
whom you are cooking. Give it (chopping onions, making food, loving) your
<em>whole</em> attention, and see what happens. Thank you DW, for this wisdom, and
for the food.
<ul>
<li>(Dear reader, between you and me, man that guy was burning so bright&hellip;)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Practice will boost your powers of attention. This will deeply improve you,
and how you interact with others.</li>
<li>Kindness is still the most important super power.</li>
<li>Check up on yourself every day, about all of these completely random words.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="multiplicity-of-you">Multiplicity of you</h2>
<p><a href="/2018/06/10/weekly-head-voices-145-the-narrating-self/#homo-deus">In 2018, I talked about <em>Homo Deus</em></a>, a book by Yuval Harari in which he
discusses several thought-provoking ideas, one of which I highlighted then and
would like to discuss again now:</p>
<p>Your experience of being a single identity, a single <em>I</em>, is most probably an
illusion, as your brain most probably houses more &ldquo;me&quot;s than you would think.</p>
<p>Research by the Nobel prize-winner Daniel Kahneman and his various
collaborators showed that we house at the very least two major selves, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow#Two_selves">namely
the remembering / narrating self and the experiencing self</a>.</p>
<p>The experiencing self is the one who actually does the living and the
<em>experiencing</em> of each moment, while the narrating self is the one who
continuously stitches together your whole story, often bending the truth to fit
its (your) opinions of yourself and those around you.</p>
<p>The narrating self is the one who dominates, for better or for worse.</p>
<p>Kahnemann himself pointed out the irony of this the best:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Odd as it may seem, I am my remembering self, and the experiencing self, who
does my living, is like a stranger to me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(You might have heard of <a href="https://positivepsychology.com/what-is-peak-end-theory/">Peak-End Theory</a>, or the phenomenon that humans tend to
judge an experience based largley on the single peak moment, and on how they
felt at the end. You can thank your remembering self for this, and you can
imagine how this could really complicate your decision making.)</p>
<p>Harari discusses Kahneman&rsquo;s selves, but continues into more research with
people who for various reasons have separated brain hemispheres.</p>
<p>When you show one brain hemisphere one version of reality, and the other
another, it is as if there are multiple narrating selves in the same person who
come up with stories that they are convinced are the truth, although in this
case these stories conflict diametrically with other thanks to the design of
the experiment.</p>
<p>From this and other data, Harari concludes that humans generally house multiple
identities.</p>
<p>What I want to to get at, is that it helps to remember (always) that &ldquo;you&rdquo; are
in fact a collection of sometimes competing &ldquo;you&quot;s.</p>
<p>As if that were not challenging enough, your narrating self takes
responsibility for all of these feelings, and tries to weave it all into a
consistent story, although that is often extremely difficult or even
impossible.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.samharris.org/blog/the-illusion-of-the-self2">an 2012 interview with Sam Harris</a>, Bruce Hood had the following to say about
this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By rejecting the notion of a core self and considering how we are a multitude
of competing urges and impulses, I think it is easier to understand why we
suddenly go off the rails. It explains why we act, often unconsciously, in a
way that is inconsistent with our self image &ndash; or the image of our self as we
believe others see us.</p>
<p>That said, the self illusion is probably an inescapable experience we need for
interacting with others and the world, and indeed we cannot readily abandon or
ignore its influence, but we should be skeptical that each of us is the
coherent, integrated entity we assume we are.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because this thought has become much more prominent for me in quite a positive
way, I would like to take it even further, by reminding you to practise
reminding yourself of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Although your perception is generally tied to your narrating self (the one
that&rsquo;s going to remember this blog post), the complete &ldquo;you&rdquo; in fact
constitutes the whole playing field, the consciousness and its physical
medium, in which <em>all</em> of these selves live and move around. In the words of
Harris, &ldquo;you can drop back into that&rdquo; and just <em>be</em> the consciousness, <em>be</em> that
which contains it all.</li>
<li>While your own selves truly live in this conciousness, high definition
versions of your surroundings and everyone you interact with are also
running in this same (your) neural network.
<ul>
<li>This means that you have a surprising amount of control of how you
experience life.</li>
<li>When you hear a dog barking, this is really nothing more than clusters of
neurons firing in your brain, but you visualize the dog <em>over there</em>. When
you feel the wind blowing over your skin, there&rsquo;s just another set of
neurons firing not far away from the barking dog. It&rsquo;s all inside your
head, and the borders between &ldquo;inside&rdquo; and &ldquo;outside&rdquo; are far more blurry
than you might think.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All of your selves are <em>you</em>. Treat them like you would a group of your closest
friends. You can hold them up to the group&rsquo;s standards, but you have to
forgive, and you have to be kind.</li>
</ul>
<p>Folks, I wish you all (and all the yous), and all of your people, peace and
love.</p>
