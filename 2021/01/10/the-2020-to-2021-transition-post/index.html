You can get a list of all of the transition posts by going to the &ldquo;transition&rdquo; tag page.
If you don&rsquo;t have time to read them all (haha), you could just scan through last year&rsquo;s 2019 to 2020 edition.
This transition tradition started at the end of 2009, which coincidentally is also the year that the Weekly Head Voices was born."><meta property="og:type" content="website"><meta property="og:locale" content="en_US"><meta property="og:url" content="https://cpbotha.net/2021/01/10/the-2020-to-2021-transition-post/"><meta property="og:image" content="https://cpbotha.net/2021/01/10/the-2020-to-2021-transition-post/leopards_kloof_hu5764d9b19d63464c70ccbed24cb90bd6_4357448_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg"><link rel="shortcut icon" href=/favicon.ico><link href=https://cpbotha.net/webfonts/ptserif/main.css rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link href=https://cpbotha.net/webfonts/source-code-pro/main.css rel=stylesheet type=text/css><style>@import 'https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Newsreader:ital,wght@0,400;0,700;1,400;1,700&family=Roboto:ital,wght@0,400;0,700;1,400;1,700&display=swap'</style><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cpbotha.net/css/style.css><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.101.0"></head><body><div id=container><header id=header><div id=header-outer class=outer><div id=header-inner class=inner><a id=main-nav-toggle class=nav-icon href=javascript:;></a>

now literally hundreds of them), along with the ever-evolving but also fading
network of neurons in my head (probably at least a few hundred of them too!),
benefit from an occasional higher-level connecting of some of the dots.</p><p>In the introduction of the <a href=/2019/01/06/the-2018-to-2019-transition-post/>2018 to 2019 transition post</a>, I ramble on slightly
more about the multiscalar nature of my subjective experience, and how that is
reflected in my notes database, of which this blog is one aspect.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s get on with it!</p><h2 id=noteworthy-snippets-through-the-lens-of-this-blog>Noteworthy snippets through the lens of this blog</h2><h3 id=covid-19>COVID-19</h3><p>One of the biggest issues for most people last year and still at this moment is
COVID-19.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re interested, you could take a look at the Weekly Head Voices posts
that had something to say about <a href=/tags/covid19/>COVID-19</a>, but you don&rsquo;t really have to.</p><p>Fortunately, world-wide vaccination has commenced. However, we have to keep our
fingers crossed that:</p><ol><li>The world succeeds in getting the vaccine to a sufficient number of humans
on time.</li><li>A vaccine-resistant strain does not happen. It could, because math, and
because evolution (selection pressure due to the vaccine, doh),</li></ol><p>Whether the above outcomes realise or not, I do also hope that we retain as
many as possible of the lessons we have been learning thanks to the pandemic.</p><ul><li>Mask-wearing and generally improved hygeine with the major goal of protecting
our fellow humans are great habits.</li><li>We have made great strides towards the future of work, where many workers (by
far not all, but it&rsquo;s a good meaningful chunk) are able to commute less,
pollute less, better organize the interaction of their work and family lives
and, importantly, their work is measured by its value and not by the number
of hours it takes place in.</li><li>We humans are in this (today pandemic, tomorrow something else!) together.</li></ul><h3 id=lazar-focus-the-side-project-that-got-released>Lazar Focus: The side-project that got released</h3><p>Around these parts we have a rich tradition of starting but then never
finishing side-projects, and the concomitant giant side-project graveyard to
show for it.</p><p>This year, I did manage to ship the little distraction blocker tool I wrote,
called <a href=https://lazarfocused.com/>Lazar Focus</a>. The <a href=/2020/05/31/weekly-head-voices-196-get-focused/#lazar-focus-the-super-tiny-windows-app-and-website-distraction-blocker-that-you-ve-always-wanted>first WHV mentioning was #196</a>.</p><p>In addition to the fact that this little tool has ended up helping me to rescue
many aspirant unproductive days, it has sold more than 10 copies, which was my
life goal for this project.</p><h3 id=the-pygmalion-effect>The Pygmalion effect</h3><p>From Adam Grant&rsquo;s book Give and Take, I learned about the <a href=/2020/08/10/weekly-head-voices-201-i-dont-have-to-miss-dr-topol/#the-pygmalion-effect>Pygmalion effect</a>,
where a teacher&rsquo;s <em>belief</em> in the intrinsic capabilities of a student, whether
those were justified or not at the time, had a significant and enduring
positive, one could say potentially life-changing, effect on that student&rsquo;s
performance.</p><p>Besides the bit about the Pygmalion effect, <a href=/2020/08/10/weekly-head-voices-201-i-dont-have-to-miss-dr-topol/>that post (WHV #201)</a> contains a
micro-summary of the Shape Up book by Basecamp, which is also worth a look.</p><h3 id=take-the-day-off-to-go-run-in-the-mountain>Take the day off to go run in the mountain</h3><p>During the year, for example in <a href=/2020/09/12/weekly-head-voices-203-spiritual/#life-progress-update>WHV #203</a> when I took my birthday off to go
running in the mountains, I learned that taking days off on the birthdays of you
and your loved ones to go do stuff outdoors is a Great Idea(tm).</p><p>(I also learned that sometimes you don&rsquo;t even need an excuse. Just take the day
off and go run in the mountains.)</p><h3 id=use-it-or-lose-it>Use it or lose it</h3><p>The human system is amazingly adaptable.</p><p>The price that we pay for that flexibility is that each and every one of our
learned capabilities requires continuous practice in order to be maintained.</p><p>In short humans, <a href=/2020/12/23/weekly-head-voices-212-use-it-or-lose-it/#use-it-or-lose-it>use it, or lose it</a>.</p><h3 id=fool-your-mind>Fool your mind</h3><p>I&rsquo;m making peace with the fact that I apparently need to apply, continuously,
various silly tricks to keep <a href=/2020/10/10/weekly-head-voices-206-mount-ceder/#my-mind-is-a-slippery-eel>the slippery eel that is my mind</a> on the
straight-and-narrow.</p><p>As a shining example, <a href=/2020/11/07/weekly-head-voices-208-stilbaai/#back-to-reality-an-18-minute-plan-for-managing-your-day>the refocus reminder</a>, a bell that reminds you at hourly
intervals to focus, indeed sounds a bit silly but adds a great deal of value.</p><p>My favourite example from last year however is creating yet more (but smaller!)
habits to kickstart my bigger habits, in this case a <a href=/2020/12/12/weekly-head-voices-211-table-mountain-run-ish/#wetware-checklist-to-bootstrap-your-software-checklist>3-item morning checklist
to kickstart the more daunting full day checklist</a>.</p><p>The morning bootstrap checklist is, at the risk of sounding like a startup-bro:</p><ol><li>meditation,</li><li>deep reading and</li><li>planning.</li></ol><h2 id=blogging-stats>Blogging stats</h2><p>Since February 17 of 2020 when I <a href=/2020/02/23/weekly-head-voices-189-all-systems-green/#the-whole-cpbothanet-hive-has-been-migrated-to-a-small-hetzner-server>migrated everything to a small Hetzner VPS</a>,
the server log files tell me that cpbotha.net saw just over 157000 unique
visitors, which is 492 per day on average.</p><p>I wrote 30 posts on cpbotha.net during 2020, of which 25 were editions of the
Weekly Head Voices.</p><p>Thanks to the shiny new archive page I put together today, you can now finally
<a href=/archive/#2020>see all of 2020&rsquo;s posts in one place</a>, or of any other year, should you be more
into the older stuff.</p><p>In addition to the cpbotha.net posts, I also published 11 posts over on
<a href=https://vxlabs.com/>vxlabs.com</a>.</p><p>In addition to the regular WHV posts, I&rsquo;m happy to have published what will
hopefully be only the first in a whole collection of book notes posts, namely
<a href=/2020/12/22/book-notes-creativity-inc/>Notes on the book &ldquo;Creativity, Inc.&rdquo; by Ed Catmull with Amy Wallace</a>.</p><p>It&rsquo;s chunky at just over 7000 words, but it will give you a pretty good idea of
the contents of the much more substantial book it is based on!</p><h3 id=details-for-nerds>Details for nerds</h3><p>This is the invocation I used to generate reports from the nginx log files
using the <a href=https://goaccess.io/>goaccess</a> tool:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#586e75;background-color:#eee8d5;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>zcat -f -- /var/log/nginx/cpbotha.net.access.log.*.gz |<span style=color:#2aa198>\

</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id=running>Running</h2><p>In 2020 I seem to have run just 100 metres shy of 1100km. (Typical&mldr;)</p><p>More would have been good, but I&rsquo;m happy with this.</p><p>Exercise did take a bit of a hit due to <a href=/2020/04/13/weekly-head-voices-191-covid-19-part-2/#exercise>lockdown</a>, although I could definitely
have squeezed more in.</p><p>Whatever the case may be, the aggregated amount of enjoyment and satisfaction
was astronomical.</p><p>A personal highlight was <a href=/2020/10/24/weekly-head-voices-207-kogelberg/#random-notes-on-the-kogelberg-trail-adventure>running the 24km(ish) Kogelberg trail with a tiny
crew that included two of my Dutch family members</a>.</p><p>(These blog retrospectives are strange, because they are also life
retrospectives, but they shouldn&rsquo;t get too personal. I would be remiss however
if I did not mention that having these specific Dutch peeps here in 2020 was
magical. I am going to miss them terribly.)</p><p>Also thanks to said peeps, I did more trail running this year than ever before.</p><p>It turns out that I am surrounded by beautiful trails. WHO KNEW?!</p><p>The other highlight I want to mention was <a href=/about/weekly-head-voices-abbreviations>GOU#1</a> running her first race, the
distributed <a href=/2020/11/07/weekly-head-voices-208-stilbaai/#running-and-reading>CTM 10km in Jonkershoek</a>. Here&rsquo;s to many more GOU kilometres!</p><h2 id=mindfulness>Mindfulness</h2><p>Thanks to some strict words by friend PK during the year, I got solidly back on
the daily meditation train, which ended up being the start of a streak of
(workday) morning meditation longer than anything I&rsquo;ve been able to maintain up
to now.</p><p>(The bootstrap checklist in <a href=#fool-your-mind>Fool Your Mind</a> above might also have contributed to
this.)</p><p>The Waking Up course by Sam Harris has been amazing for more than two years
now, and even more so when trying to build and keep up a daily meditation
habit.</p><p>What I especially like about Waking Up is its focus on the explicit practice of
the experience of consciousness and the role (or non-role) of the self within
that. (for a tiny example, see <a href=/2020/10/24/weekly-head-voices-207-kogelberg/#find-a-place-in-the-universe-that-is-your-consciousness>WHV #207</a>)</p><p>Practising this daily has been an experience that I can only recommend in the
strongest terms.</p><p>(Please let me know if you&rsquo;d like to try a month for free. As a subscriber, I
get to give these out to as many peeps as I want to.)</p><h2 id=life-systems-2021>Life Systems 2021</h2><p>The WHV approach to life, the universe and everything (also known as &ldquo;WALUE&rdquo;,
but you have to over-emphasize the terribly soft &ldquo;W&rdquo;) has been evolving for a
few years now, but it was most recently summarised in <a href=/2020/06/16/weekly-head-voices-198-short-update-for-future-me/#post-scriptum-the-whv-approach-to-life-the-universe-and-everything>WHV #198</a>.</p><p>At the basis of this approach we find the two formidable pillars of</p><ol><li><em>love</em> and</li><li><em>science</em>,</li></ol><p>and in that order. On top of these pillars rest <a href=/2017/07/30/weekly-head-voices-124-ceci-nest-pas-dennui/>The WHV&rsquo;s Two no Three Rules
for Achieving Great Success in Life, or Just Surviving, Whichever Comes First</a>.</p><p>The two no three rules are:</p><ol><li>Be useful.</li><li>Be likable.</li><li>Evolve.</li></ol><p>In the previous transition post, I talked about <a href=/2020/01/12/the-2019-to-2020-transition-post/#plans-and-life-directions-for-2020>six personal daily life
directions</a>, the continuous reformulation of which I had integrated into my
morning routine.</p><p>It was a good start, but the life directions were a bit too specific, and six
separate things is too many to keep at the core of your thoughts.</p><p>Motivated by this, and also by <a href=https://lexfridman.com/chris-lattner-2/>the Lex Fridman podcast with Chris Lattner</a>
wherein Lattner, an amazing engineer, but more importantly such a kind human
being, underlined the importance to him of always continuing to grow and learn,
I mashed together everything I had to come up with two clusters of daily life
directions:</p><ol><li>Grow, learn, build, enjoy. (motion)</li><li>Be useful. Be likeable. Be kind. (self-checks)</li></ol><p>In the stupid-dimensional universe that is my mind, I know that these
directions are obviously in the spirit of WALUE, but I can&rsquo;t yet articulate
clearly how they relate to the pillars and the rules of WALUE.</p><p>Maybe they&rsquo;re just a neat little pile on top, or a little bit to the side,
leaning against the WALUE building?</p><p>Whatever the case may be, they have been part of my daily checklist for a few
months now, and they seem to work in the sense of being practical, checkable
and tiny enough to keep in mind always.</p><h2 id=plans--for-tomorrow-at-least>Plans (for tomorrow, at least)</h2><p>This bit is quite scary.</p><p>I hardly know what&rsquo;s going to happen tomorrow, and here I wanted to talk about
plans for the whole year!</p><p>So, to be clear, what I&rsquo;ve listed below is limited to the concrete items that I
can see before me right now.</p><h3 id=the-absolute-basics>The absolute basics</h3><ul><li>Attempt to apply <a href=#life-systems-2021>Life Systems 2021</a> all of the time.</li><li>Practise mindfulness every day.</li><li>If I&rsquo;m wondering whether I should go run, the answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.</li></ul><h3 id=comms-upgrade>Comms upgrade</h3><p>I would like to level up my communication game.</p><p>Work from home is here to stay, and that&rsquo;s a good thing, but it has muffled my
face-to-face communication modality, something that has had a profound impact
on my full communication suite.</p><p>Most of the clever folks now agree that <a href=/2020/09/20/weekly-head-voices-205-real-time-sometimes-async-most-of-the-time/#the-future-of-work-episode-23>the correct answer is asynchronous
communication</a>. Future-facing companies like Basecamp and <a href=https://blog.doist.com/asynchronous-communication/>Doist have been
preaching this long before COVID-19</a>.</p><p>To be more specific, I need to figure out first how to do asynchronous
communication in my daily work, and then to become really good at it.</p><h3 id=write-more-about-good-books>Write more about good books</h3><p>I&rsquo;m planning to publish more focused book notes like the recently appeared
<a href=/2020/12/22/book-notes-creativity-inc/>Creativity, Inc. post</a>.</p><p>It&rsquo;s great reading these books, but I&rsquo;ve noticed that if I&rsquo;m planning to
publish book notes, I read more intently, I take better notes, and the extra
processing stage before starting to put together a blog post really helps me to
integrate the knowledge contained in the book.</p><p>Every good book one is able to integrate is in fact a cheap, but possibly
game-changing firmware upgrade&mldr;</p><h2 id=wishes-for-2021-for-you>Wishes for 2021, for you</h2><p>Thank you for reading this. I am grateful that you&rsquo;re here.</p><p>I wish you and everyone you hold dear the best 2021 possible.</p><p>Quite concretely, we can all help to make this happen by being as kind as we
possibly can to as many fellow humans as we possibly can.</p><p>In the words of a fellow traveller: SMÉAGOL OUT!</p></div><div class=article-toc><h3>Contents</h3><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><ul><li><a href=#noteworthy-snippets-through-the-lens-of-this-blog>Noteworthy snippets through the lens of this blog</a><ul><li><a href=#covid-19>COVID-19</a></li><li><a href=#lazar-focus-the-side-project-that-got-released>Lazar Focus: The side-project that got released</a></li><li><a href=#the-pygmalion-effect>The Pygmalion effect</a></li><li><a href=#take-the-day-off-to-go-run-in-the-mountain>Take the day off to go run in the mountain</a></li><li><a href=#use-it-or-lose-it>Use it or lose it</a></li><li><a href=#fool-your-mind>Fool your mind</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#blogging-stats>Blogging stats</a><ul><li><a href=#details-for-nerds>Details for nerds</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#running>Running</a></li><li><a href=#mindfulness>Mindfulness</a></li><li><a href=#life-systems-2021>Life Systems 2021</a></li><li><a href=#plans--for-tomorrow-at-least>Plans (for tomorrow, at least)</a><ul><li><a href=#the-absolute-basics>The absolute basics</a></li><li><a href=#comms-upgrade>Comms upgrade</a></li><li><a href=#write-more-about-good-books>Write more about good books</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#wishes-for-2021-for-you>Wishes for 2021, for you</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div><footer class=article-footer><ul class=article-tag-list><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/101-mind-tricks>101 mind-tricks</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/blogging>blogging</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/books>books</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/covid19>covid19</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/life-directions>life directions</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/mindfulness>mindfulness</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/running>running</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/transition>transition</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/gou>gou</a></li></ul></footer></div><nav id=article-nav><a href=/2021/01/10/super-simple-yearly-post-archives-hugo/ id=article-nav-newer class=article-nav-link-wrap><div class=article-nav-title><span>&lt;</span>&nbsp;
