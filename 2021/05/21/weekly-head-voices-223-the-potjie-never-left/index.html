of practical guidelines for developers.</p><p>It is also 100% free and open source, and can be accessed <a href=https://vxlabs.com/software-development-handbook/>over at the vxlabs</a>.</p><p>None of this will be surprising for any of you experienced developers, but it&rsquo;s
super handy having a single place that you can point folks at when you have
some specific advice in mind.</p><p>My personal favourite and most important guideline is <a href=https://vxlabs.com/software-development-handbook/#comment-your-code>&ldquo;Comment your code&rdquo;</a>. It
seems that this advice really can&rsquo;t be repeated often enough.</p><p>The first commit (i.e. words written) happened on December 14 of 2020, and
version 1 published on 2021-05-03. Most of this had to happen in between other
activities, but that&rsquo;s ok. This is one of the <a href=/2021/01/26/weekly-head-voices-214-one-main-thing/#interstitial-projects>interstitial projects</a> I implied
in January.</p><h2 id=world-in-my-eyes>World in my eyes</h2><p>The photo at the start of this post was taken at the entrance of Vergelegen, at
about 7km into an absolute epic Saturday late afternoon run.</p><p>It was epic, because the autumn weather was absolutely perfect, my running
mechanism was smooth and efficient, and there was great music piping into my
brain via the recently acquired JBL Endurance Run bluetooth earphones.</p><p>I mention the earphones specifically, because for the first time I had found
something that fit perfectly and even advertised being &ldquo;sweatproof&rdquo; on the box,
a characteristic that is quite important when you produce as much sweat as I
do. (TMI, but please bear with me here)</p><p>I was so satisfied after five or six runs that I had taken a few photos earlier
that day, as I was planning a short blog post extolling the virtues of said
gadget.</p><p>Probably about 60 seconds after I took the photo, running back out to the road,
thinking to myself how great these earphones were working and how far I was
still going to run and how amazing everything is, the right earphone starts
going &ldquo;GGGGGGGHHHHHRRRRRRRRGGGGGWWWWWGGGGHHHHHH&rdquo; (you have to read that with an
authentic, hard Dutch guttural) and it simply does not stop.</p><p>&ldquo;Have you tried switching them off and on again?&rdquo; you might say.</p><p>Well, the sound just kept on going, switched on, or off.</p><p>No amount of power cycling, shaking, re-pairing or swearing made any
difference.</p><p>Right earphone just kept on going &ldquo;GGGGGGGHHHRRRRRGGGGHHHHH&rdquo;.</p><p>I finally bundled up the JBL TripSpoiler BT into my hand, and ran home, like a
person who runs without music.</p><p>P.S. The section title is a Depeche Mode song (one of my teenage favourites) in
which the highest mountain is contrasted with the deepest sea, albeit in a
utterly different context.</p><p>P.P.S. As I write this, takealot is sending me a replacement set. I&rsquo;m hoping
the new unit is an anti-lemon.</p><h2 id=pretty-hip-birthday-party>Pretty hip birthday party</h2><p>GOU #2 held her 11th party here at our facility.</p><p>The plans started out as a VR party (or at least that&rsquo;s what I thought), but
great forces out of my control determined that There Would Also Need to Be
Karaoke.</p><p>This is one time where the more technically inclined dads can shine!</p><p>I purchased exactly one cheap but great value Karaoke microphone (the Samson
SCR10S Karaoke Dynamic Microphone with Switch, if you must know), and then
mixed everything together using an old Windows laptop, our old burglary-proof
(when flat screens were still thick) TV with HDMI input, and a bunch of cables.</p><p>Friends arrived, and an extremely fun-looking and partially sugar-fuelled
teenage chaos ensued.</p><p>Interestingly, the VR setup ended up getting a significant chunk of the
attention. Even amongst these ultra-connected digital natives, the tech is
still new enough to garner a substantial amount of the unobtainium aka
attention.</p><p>(Although I never ever sing, not even in the shower, that karaoke setup has a
surprisingly strong magnetic force, if you catch my drift. GOU #2 was quite
relieved when none of her parents decided to make a guest appearance at the
main event. In my case, it&rsquo;s really for the better.)</p><h2 id=boomer-party>Boomer party</h2><p>A few days later, after we had sufficiently recovered from the teenage party,
it was time to invite long time friends of ours over for an old people party.</p><p>As is our wont down here, when the friends are this dear, we take time to make
a potjie.</p><p>The autumn weather contributed fabulously, and so we enjoyed scenes like this:</p><figure><a href=chicken-curry-potjie-2021.jpg><img sizes="(min-width: 35em) 1200px, 100vw" srcset='https://cpbotha.net/2021/05/21/weekly-head-voices-223-the-potjie-never-left/chicken-curry-potjie-2021_hu4ef2407d2d9072b862053f2bb470f814_1889922_480x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 480w,

<a href=/2019/01/26/weekly-head-voices-160-write-stuff-down/>a post back in January of 2016</a>, when I initiated the pot with coincidentally
the same recipe.</p><p>The potjie scene seems to repeat itself (these are not the only two examples),
acting as a sort of reliable cast iron backdrop (with enamel coating!) for our
family and friendship rituals.</p><p>On this day, the ritual was indeed sublime.</p></div><div class=article-toc><h3>Contents</h3><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><ul><li><a href=#vxlabs-software-development-handbook-v1-is-out>vxlabs software development handbook v1 is out</a></li><li><a href=#world-in-my-eyes>World in my eyes</a></li><li><a href=#pretty-hip-birthday-party>Pretty hip birthday party</a></li><li><a href=#boomer-party>Boomer party</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div><footer class=article-footer><ul class=article-tag-list><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/gou>gou</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/gou-2>gou-2</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/potjie>potjie</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/running>running</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/software-development>software development</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/vxlabs>vxlabs</a></li></ul></footer></div><nav id=article-nav><a href=/2021/05/29/weekly-head-voices-224-zen-machine/ id=article-nav-newer class=article-nav-link-wrap><div class=article-nav-title><span>&lt;</span>&nbsp;
