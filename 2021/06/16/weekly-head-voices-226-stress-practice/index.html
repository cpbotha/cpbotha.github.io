As I put these finishing touches on the post, it&rsquo;s Wednesday, June 16 (Youth Day), 16:09.

Day</a>), 16:09. I have just spent about an hour debugging my usually super smooth
Emacs Org-mode / <a href=https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo>ox-hugo</a> blogging machine (read <a href=https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/447>this github issue</a> for more

to pass more quickly, for fairly obvious reasons.</p><p>However, when you&rsquo;re a few days from the darkest point in the year, it&rsquo;s hard
not to.</p><p>We currently have 9 hours and 56 minutes of daylight.</p><p>That&rsquo;s just two minutes, and a few days, from the winter solstice on June 21,
when we&rsquo;ll have to make do with 9 hours and 54 minutes of daylight.</p><p>I mention this here, because those 6 AM wake-ups feel more and more like the
middle of the night.</p><p>After the solstice, I&rsquo;ll start imagining the sun coming up a few moments
earlier every morning, and it will.</p><p>(Well, it will, eventually. Reader WIMM just pointed out via email that
although the days start getting longer, the sunrise will initially become even
a minute later, before finally becoming earlier starting from July 11. Read
more <a href=https://theconversation.com/why-the-sunrise-is-still-later-after-the-winter-solstice-shortest-day-77628>here</a> (thanks WIMM) or check the tables <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/sun/south-africa/stellenbosch?month=6&year=2021">here</a>.)</p><p>It has been &mldr; <code>1 year and 11 months</code> &mldr; since <a href=/2019/07/25/weekly-head-voices-174-i-row-row-row-your-boat/>the previous mention of winter
solstice on this blog</a>.</p><h2 id=avoid-the-jbl-endurance-run-bt-earphones-at-all-costs>Avoid the JBL Endurance Run BT earphones at all costs</h2><p>A month ago <a href=/2021/05/21/weekly-head-voices-223-the-potjie-never-left/#world-in-my-eyes>I wrote about the JBL Endurance Run BT earphones</a> that I was
initially so happy with, which then spontaneously broke after a few hours of
running, and which I then returned for a replacement.</p><p>Well, the replacement set of <a href="https://eu.jbl.com/JBL+ENDURANCE+RUNBT.html?dwvar%5FJBL%20ENDURANCE%20RUNBT%5Fcolor=Black-GLOBAL-Current">proudly sweat-proof JBL Endurance Run BT earphones</a>
lasted for about 9 hours of running, at which point they spontaneously broke in
exactly the same way.</p><p>Out of nowhere, the loud crackling sound started in the earpiece opposite to
the site with the control unit.</p><p>This crackling sound (similar to the disturbance you hear when speaker wires
have a connection issue) did not stop, even after un-pairing and even after
switching off the unit.</p><p>Connecting the charger after this would result in the charge light flickering
and fading in-and-out in a decidedly analogue fashion.</p><p>After experiencing the exact same problem with two different units, I am wary
wasting more time on a third set.</p><p>This was quite a disappointment, because mechanically this design was perfect
for me.</p><p>I will continue on my search for the perfect (1. secure in my large and
sometimes perspiring ears, so needs something in addition to just ear canal fit
and 2. durable, i.e. continues working <em>long</em> after the first 9 hours of
running) set of running earphones, and I&rsquo;ll keep you up to date on my findings.</p><p>In the meantime, please avoid the JBL Endurance Run BT earphones.</p><h2 id=remote-work-culture-is-hard-work>Remote work culture is hard work</h2><p>During our Tuesday evening meetup, Theunis de Klerk of <a href=https://www.noldor.co.za/>Noldor</a> (the now fully
remote tech company, not <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noldor>the race of elves from Middle Earth</a>, although there is
a link here) gave an interesting and inspiring talk on how they have built and
cultivate great remote work culture.</p><p>This was an insightful look into an organization where the top leadership
continuously pours a great deal of thought and energy into maintaining healthy
culture, even in a fully remote environment with parts in different timezones.</p><p>On the one hand, it&rsquo;s great seeing working examples like this, on the other, it
can be quite a daunting prospect when you start thinking about how to apply
this in your own environment.</p><p>I believe that the future of knowledge work will <em>not</em> involve highly qualified
folks having to spend 8 hours per day at their desk because we still have not
learned that work is all about contributing value, and not about the number of
hours spent in captivity at one&rsquo;s desk.</p><p>That being said, during the current global remote working experiment, although
we are learning how to roll with value-generation, I do miss some of the almost
effortlessly and socially generated collaboration glue that at its best gets
folks almost instinctively chasing the same worthy goals.</p><p>(On the other hand, at its worst, it causes conflicts, grudges and ulcers, so
there&rsquo;s that&mldr;)</p><p>I would like to wrap this ramble up with one conclusion, and one interesting
tweet storm by Steven Sinofsky of Andreesen Horowitz:</p><ul><li>Conclusion: 1. Am I overestimating how &ldquo;easy&rdquo; social cohesion was when we
were in the office? 2. How do we go about getting back that real or imagined
social cohesion in this fully remote setting?</li><li><a href=https://a16z.com/2021/06/12/disruption-at-work-its-more-than-just-wfh/>Highly interesting tweet storm about the issue being larger and more
intricate than just WFH vs hybrid vs HQ</a></li></ul><h2 id=eternal-practice-vs-stress>Eternal practice vs stress</h2><p>I do need to note here (for future me) that I was consistently far grumpier
than usual for the last few days of the week under examination here.</p><p>When I say grumpy, I do mean quite detectably so.</p><p>This is definitely not my preferred state, so I&rsquo;m even meta-grumpy about that.</p><p>My retro- and introspection during the weekend came up with &ldquo;more stress than
usual&rdquo;, which is indeed probably a main contributor (wow, thanks work).</p><p>However, being grumpy or not is still fully my responsibility.</p><p>Increased stress at work is currently primarily due to new responsibilities and
the (often amplified by one&rsquo;s own imagination) expectations of colleagues, and
the unsurprising feeling of discomfort that is associated with finding oneself
faced with new kinds of challenges that you are not accustomed to (<em>cf.</em>
&ldquo;comfort zone&rdquo; and <a href=/2013/11/11/creative-process-stage-5-whv-67/>stages 2 to 4 of the creative process</a>).</p><p>During the weekend I first resolved simply to be less grumpy (yes, you can do
that).</p><p>Fortunately, I also had a spot of insight as to how the root cause, i.e. the
work-related stress, could be better addressed in my specific case.</p><p>You see, I have chosen to be in this situation. I would have preferred the new
challenges without the concomitant stress, but that&rsquo;s unfortunately not how
<em>this</em> human normally works.</p><p>The realisation that I had was that this too is simply part of my lifelong
practice session.</p><p>I first talked about the idea of life being continuous pracrtice back in <a href=/2018/02/25/weekly-head-voices-133-onder-in-my-whiskeyglas/#life-is-continuous-practice>WHV
#133</a>, and again later in <a href=/2018/06/03/weekly-head-voices-144-eternal-learner/#mastery>WHV #144</a> when I got around to reading a
reader-recommended book on the topic, titled &ldquo;Mastery&rdquo;.</p><p>Something I did not mention back then, probably because I only experience the
stress aspect as acutely at this moment, is that this particular framing helps
me to approach my current problems with curiosity, with an appetite for
learning and experimentation, and with the acceptance that my performance could
be far from perfect, perhaps even to the point of failure.</p><p>Some days will be good and some days will be bad.</p><p>(Even outside of the practice framing, one just has to accept that <a href=/2020/05/20/weekly-head-voices-195-pragmatic/#pragmatic-thinking-and-learning><em>some days
gonna be crap</em></a>.)</p><p>Whatever the case may be, every day is a brand new opportunity to practice the
difficult new stuff, and to become gradually better at it, until one day, just
maybe, comfort slowly starts overtaking discomfort.</p></div><div class=article-toc><h3>Contents</h3><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><ul><li><a href=#solstice-tipping-point-is-coming>Solstice tipping point is coming!</a></li><li><a href=#avoid-the-jbl-endurance-run-bt-earphones-at-all-costs>Avoid the JBL Endurance Run BT earphones at all costs</a></li><li><a href=#remote-work-culture-is-hard-work>Remote work culture is hard work</a></li><li><a href=#eternal-practice-vs-stress>Eternal practice vs stress</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div><footer class=article-footer><ul class=article-tag-list><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/backyard-philosophy>backyard philosophy</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/learning>learning</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/practice>practice</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/remote-work>remote work</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/solstice>solstice</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/winter-solstice>winter solstice</a></li></ul></footer></div><nav id=article-nav><a href=/2021/06/30/weekly-head-voices-227-reality-bending-security-blanket/ id=article-nav-newer class=article-nav-link-wrap><div class=article-nav-title><span>&lt;</span>&nbsp;
