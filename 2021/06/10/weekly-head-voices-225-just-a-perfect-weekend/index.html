Welcome (back) to the Weekly Head Voices, and specifically to the 225th installment, covering the period from Monday May 24 to Sunday June 6, 2021.
Keyboard update: K1 You&rsquo;ll remember from WHV #204 that my previous keyboard acquisition was the Womier K87 with its all-encompassing RGB and hot-swappable Gateron brown switches.
That keyboard is so much fun to type on.
It&rsquo;s hard to describe what leads to all that fun, relative to say the MS Sculpt Ergonomic (which makes a lot more sense as a typing device)."><meta property="og:type" content="website"><meta property="og:locale" content="en_US"><meta property="og:url" content="https://cpbotha.net/2021/06/10/weekly-head-voices-225-just-a-perfect-weekend/"><meta property="og:image" content="https://cpbotha.net/2021/06/10/weekly-head-voices-225-just-a-perfect-weekend/la_autumn_tree_hu2c92717c03fbdd0baeaf04b9d5a0a258_4865461_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg"><link rel="shortcut icon" href=/favicon.ico><link href=https://cpbotha.net/webfonts/ptserif/main.css rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link href=https://cpbotha.net/webfonts/source-code-pro/main.css rel=stylesheet type=text/css><style>@import 'https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Newsreader:ital,wght@0,400;0,700;1,400;1,700&family=Roboto:ital,wght@0,400;0,700;1,400;1,700&display=swap'</style><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cpbotha.net/css/style.css><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.109.0"></head><body><div id=container><header id=header><div id=header-outer class=outer><div id=header-inner class=inner><a id=main-nav-toggle class=nav-icon href=javascript:;></a>

Womier K87</a> with its all-encompassing RGB and hot-swappable Gateron brown
switches.</p><p>That keyboard is so much fun to type on.</p><p>It&rsquo;s hard to describe what leads to all that fun, relative to say the MS Sculpt
Ergonomic (which makes a lot more sense as a typing device).</p><p>Perhaps it is the case that fingers also like the exercise, just like their
human owners.</p><p>I was not planning to buy any keyboards again soon, but:</p><ul><li>I was quite curious whether low profile key switches (that is, slightly less
finger travel) would be a good compromise between the fun of the Womier and the
efficiency of the Sculpt.</li><li>The K1 was on my list of candidates of keyboards with low-profile mechanical
switches.</li><li>I find it difficult to resist a good deal.</li></ul><p>You see, a friendly little bird (who also hangs out on the keyboards channel of
the zatech slack) told me about the extra-special Takealot birthday special
discount on <a href=https://www.imore.com/keychron-k1-v4-review>the Keychron K1 V4 87-key keyboard</a>.</p><p>Fast-forward a credit card transaction, a week of waiting for delivery and
another week of getting accustomed to the new board, and here we are, with at
least me typing these words on the new K1.</p><p>It took a while to get used to the keycaps, which can be a slippery sometimes
(or rather, my finger tip traction is variable), but my typing speed and
accuracy on this thing are in the neighbourhood of where they should be.</p><p>The thing is a great deal more <em>stylish</em> than my Womier; the Womier is that
guilty pleasure 80s disco that you really love, the K1 could work in a serious
coffee shop.</p><p>Also, having a keyboard which can switch this easily between wired operation
(the default for my desktop) and three different bluetooth connections is
pretty convenient. On trips where I usually only take the MacBook, I could
consider taking the K1 along when I have to do A Great Deal of Serious Typing.</p><p>All of that being said, I can&rsquo;t yet say if the low profile switches are indeed
the compromise that I wondered about. My subjective impression now is indeed
that my fingers don&rsquo;t get so physically tired as sometimes happens with the
Womier, but I&rsquo;ll have to switch between them a few times to get a better idea.</p><p>Whatever the case may be, I am certainly enjoying the experience of typing on
this thing, and I am certainly wondering about the interesting role that
different types of mechanical keyboards have begun to play in my computing
life.</p><h2 id=lessons-about-a-new-book-notes-post-about-seven-and-a-half-lessons-about-the-brain>Lessons about a new book notes post about Seven and a Half Lessons about the Brain</h2><p>After two months of early(ish) morning typing on various keyboards, I finally
managed to wrap up <a href=/2021/06/05/book-notes-seven-and-a-half-lessons-about-the-brain/>my book notes about Seven and a Half Lessons about the
Brain</a>, a fantastic book by neuro-scientist and psychologist Lisa Feldman
Barrett.</p><p>I had plans, in retrospect clearly too ambitious, to have at least two (2) book
notes posts out in Q1 of this year (after it took me months to complete <a href=/2020/12/22/book-notes-creativity-inc/>my book
notes on Creativity, Inc.</a> by the end of last year).</p><p>That goal was necessarily postponed to Q2, and as we can all see now, there is
not enough time for a second post like this.</p><p>Either I have to change the format of the book notes to something more compact,
like a bunch of bullet lists, or I should make peace with the fact that I write
these like I write them, a little prose with quotes interspersed that can
generally be read like a mini story itself, and with the fact that they&rsquo;re
going to take as much time as they do.</p><p>Sometimes I have mixed feelings about the practice itself.</p><p>It takes fragments of hobby time spread out over weeks, fragments of time that
I could probably use for more reading, other interesting tidbits and, uhm,
extra work.</p><p>On the other hand, it feels like a sort of a mini-rebellion doing exactly this,
assembling so many little pieces into something slightly more coherent and
significant, something that stands apart from work.</p><p>It seems I do know what to do.</p><p>Thanks for the chat!</p><h2 id=perfect-weekends-and-the-necessary-reminders-that-precede-them>Perfect weekends and the necessary reminders that precede them</h2><p>The weekend of June 4, 2021, was unexpectedly perfect, and I would like to make
note of that here for future me.</p><p>This is the recipe that we followed, utterly by happy accident:</p><ul><li>1x reminder during the week to really focus on the now.</li><li>1x absolutely perfect autumn weather package: balmy 20ish degrees Celsius,
lots of sun, very little wind.</li><li>3x braais, one per day, with various subsets of family.</li><li>2x runs: one a long weekend morning run, and the other an unplanned one
with GOU#1.</li><li>1x polishing and publishing of the blog post mentioned above.</li><li>1x unexpected Sunday evening star watching with GOU#2.</li></ul><p>One would think that daily practice would help, but it turns out that sometimes
a serendipitous reminder by a friend can help to switch one&rsquo;s brain into
exactly the right gear, right before the weekend.</p><p>During our Friday evening start-the-weekend ritual (it&rsquo;s a braai. surprise!), I
had my first quite visceral &ldquo;THIS, this is it, this is everything&rdquo;
experience. (so lovely)</p><p>From then on, brain remained in the right mode right through most of the
weekend.</p><p>If you ever run into me before the weekend (it&rsquo;s always before the weekend!), I
would be grateful if you could remind me that it is in fact now.</p><p>Folks, I wish you much nowness.</p></div><div class=article-toc><h3>Contents</h3><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><ul><li><a href=#keyboard-update-k1>Keyboard update: K1</a></li><li><a href=#lessons-about-a-new-book-notes-post-about-seven-and-a-half-lessons-about-the-brain>Lessons about a new book notes post about Seven and a Half Lessons about the Brain</a></li><li><a href=#perfect-weekends-and-the-necessary-reminders-that-precede-them>Perfect weekends and the necessary reminders that precede them</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div><footer class=article-footer><ul class=article-tag-list><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/autumn>autumn</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/braai>braai</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/backyard-philosophy>backyard philosophy</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/blogging>blogging</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/gou>gou</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/gou-1>gou-1</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/gou-2>gou-2</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/keyboards>keyboards</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/mindfulness>mindfulness</a></li></ul></footer></div><nav id=article-nav><a href=/2021/06/16/weekly-head-voices-226-stress-practice/ id=article-nav-newer class=article-nav-link-wrap><div class=article-nav-title><span>&lt;</span>&nbsp;
