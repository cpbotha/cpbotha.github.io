What will the beholder think? First things first: Do you notice something different about me I mean my blog?
I don&rsquo;t know how most readers respond to this sort of a thing, but I can really appreciat, in a non-professional way of course, good typography on a personal blog."><meta property="og:type" content="website"><meta property="og:locale" content="en_US"><meta property="og:url" content="https://cpbotha.net/2021/11/15/weekly-head-voices-236-surprising-power-of-consistent-chipping/"><meta property="og:image" content="https://cpbotha.net/2021/11/15/weekly-head-voices-236-surprising-power-of-consistent-chipping/facing-strand_hue5ad910e14412370c56758d9e1b42688_3284795_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg"><link rel="shortcut icon" href=/favicon.ico><link href=https://cpbotha.net/webfonts/ptserif/main.css rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link href=https://cpbotha.net/webfonts/source-code-pro/main.css rel=stylesheet type=text/css><style>@import 'https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Newsreader:ital,wght@0,400;0,700;1,400;1,700&family=Roboto:ital,wght@0,400;0,700;1,400;1,700&display=swap'</style><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cpbotha.net/css/style.css><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.101.0"></head><body><div id=container><header id=header><div id=header-outer class=outer><div id=header-inner class=inner><a id=main-nav-toggle class=nav-icon href=javascript:;></a>

appreciat, in a non-professional way of course, good typography on a personal
blog.</p><p>Over the past few years I&rsquo;ve been tweaking the CSS here and there to make small
improvements to the WHV typography, but I&rsquo;ve never been really happy with the
font.</p><p>That is, until I ran into <a href=https://alexanderobenauer.com/>Alexander Obenauer&rsquo;s blog</a> and just new that I had to
have the same serif on mine.</p><p>The font is called <a href=https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Newsreader>Newsreader</a>. I&rsquo;m currently enjoying the subtly new look, I
hope you do too.</p><h2 id=new-diagramming-tool-of-the-insert-suitable-period-here>New diagramming tool of the [insert suitable period here]</h2><p>Via Hacker News (henceforth just &ldquo;HN&rdquo;) I ran into this <a href=https://offbyone.us/posts/why-is-excalidraw-so-good/>entertaining and
charming review of a drawing tool called &ldquo;excalidraw&rdquo;</a>.</p><p>Searching a little further, I could see that it had become in a relatively
short timespan a darling of the otherwise hyper-critical HN community.</p><p>Personally, I&rsquo;m always on the lookout for any tools which I think could help me
visualize some of my ideas or plans better.</p><p>Excalidraw is great at boxes and arrows, which is fortunate, since about 95% of
my ideas and plans are based on different ways of connecting boxes and arrows.</p><p>As an aside: So far, I&rsquo;ve gotten by far the most use out of Notability on the
iPad (with 1st gen Apple Pencil), but I never produce as many diagrams as I
keep on imagining that I should be doing.</p><p>Upon first use, Excalidraw indeed struck me with how little friction it offers
to the act of sketching out <em>stuff</em>.</p><p>I especially like how the authors have somehow managed to merge super-easy
drawing on the computer with the production of diagrams that look like they&rsquo;ve
been made on a paper notebook, whilst still remaining fully vectorized.</p><p>Let me know if you&rsquo;ve used this for anything interesting, or if you have any
other diagramming tricks you&rsquo;d like to share.</p><h2 id=ok-rust-i-give-up>Ok Rust, I give up</h2><p>Back in July of 2018, in <a href=/2018/07/17/weekly-head-voices-148-data-stylist/#programming-language-addiction-update>WHV #148</a>, I wrote that after noting the fact that Rust
was an expression-oriented language (I love those) and subsequently reading the
O&rsquo;Reilly <em>Programming Rust</em> book, I had filed away the language under
&ldquo;re-evaluate whenever you reach for your trusty C++&rdquo;.</p><p>As a programming language enthusiast, I should have know that that &ldquo;filing
away&rdquo; was merely a postponement of the inevitable.</p><p>Recently, in hobby time, probably because I had not yet selected a new book to
read, and because I&rsquo;m going through a bit of a programming phase (err&mldr;), I
unfiled Rust and started going through some more of the materials.</p><p>My current feeling is: Hot durnit! Rust may just be the fastest functional
language I have access to!</p><p>I&rsquo;ve been doing a number of the <a href=https://exercism.org/tracks/rust>exercism exercises</a>, and after often pulling out
a pattern match for compact yet readable solutions, I&rsquo;ve been getting a strong
wolf-in-sheep&rsquo;s-clothing feeling.</p><p>Rust brings a number of core functional programming principles to an
exceptionally performant programming platform.</p><p>Sometimes there are still more nuts and bolts than I would like to see (to be
expected from a systems language that wants to give you full control), but this
mix of low-level and subjectively high-level functional programming is still a
remarkable achievement in my book.</p><p><em>Of course</em> I have no real-world applications in mind, unless <a href=https://adventofcode.com/>Advent of Code</a>
counts, but Rust currently makes for great programming practice.</p><h2 id=keep-on-keeping-on>Keep on keeping on</h2><p>In WHV #214 I wrote about <a href=/2021/01/26/weekly-head-voices-214-one-main-thing/#one-main-thing>writing down that One Main Thing that you&rsquo;d like to
get done every day</a>.</p><p>Day job is currently not entirely conducive to this mode of work, and that&rsquo;s
putting it lightly.</p><p>Still, on most days I do remember to select and then write that thing down.</p><p>Most recently, I was dragging such an item along with me for what felt like
weeks.</p><p>Every morning I did the Alt-W Ctrl-Y finger dance (that&rsquo;s Emacs for copy
paste), and I experienced the concomitant pang of internally facing
embarrassment.</p><p>Often there would be no progress (because meetings and other non-maker work),
but on some days I would excavate the equivalent of a generously filled
teaspoon of dirt. (<a href=https://youtu.be/4%5FC86o5dE%5Fc>Doctor Flammond&rsquo;s tunnel</a> anybody?)</p><p>Slowly but surely, the Thing neared completion, until one day (weirdly still to
my pleasant surprise) it was done, never to be copy-pasted again.</p><p>My happy little mental note was: Just keep on dragging One Main Thing with
you. It&rsquo;s not on the list because it&rsquo;s going to get completed, but rather
because it&rsquo;s the thing that you just have to keep on chipping away at,
<em>especially</em> when progress seems almost invisible.</p></div><div class=article-toc><h3>Contents</h3><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><ul><li><a href=#what-will-the-beholder-think>What will the beholder think?</a></li><li><a href=#new-diagramming-tool-of-the-insert-suitable-period-here>New diagramming tool of the [insert suitable period here]</a></li><li><a href=#ok-rust-i-give-up>Ok Rust, I give up</a></li><li><a href=#keep-on-keeping-on>Keep on keeping on</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div><footer class=article-footer><ul class=article-tag-list><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/productivity>productivity</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/programming>programming</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/rustlang>rustlang</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/tools>tools</a></li></ul></footer></div><nav id=article-nav><a href=/2022/01/23/the-2021-to-2022-transition-post/ id=article-nav-newer class=article-nav-link-wrap><div class=article-nav-title><span>&lt;</span>&nbsp;
