By “noticed”, I of course mean “got super frustrated with and considered briefly throwing the gadget onto the ground and arranging for its utter disintegration through repeated jumping on it”.</p><p>Besides losing the first 0.5 km of my run data, the pacing information, delivered via synthesised voice, would be wildly inaccurate for the rest of my run.</p><p>Judging by <a href=https://us.community.samsung.com/t5/forums/v3_1/forumtopicpage/board-id/wearabletech/thread-id/464/page/1>this 22 page thread on the Samsung community forums</a>, there are other users who were also less than happy that the Gear Fit 2 built-in GPS does not seem to work as advertised. Understandably, people bought the gadget in order to be able to go running without having to lug their smartphones along.</p><p>Fortunately, it turns out the explanation is quite logical, although Samsung really has to do better to communicate this to their users.</p><h1 id=why-does-mygear-fit-2-take-so-long-to-acquirea-gps-lock>Why does my Gear Fit 2 take so long to acquire a GPS lock?</h1><p>In short, at the start of my run, my smartphone was lying on my desk one floor up. At that point the Gear Fit 2 still had a bluetooth connection to the phone, and it was planning to use the phone GPS instead of its built-in unit. As far as I know, the gadget’s use of the phone’s GPS is not well known.</p><p>As the distance between me and the office building increased, the Gear Fit 2 obviously lost the bluetooth connection to the smartphone. With the current firmware (R360XXU1BPL1 at the time of writing), it takes the Gear Fit 2 about 0.5 km to realise that the connection is really lost, and that it should switch to its built-in GPS.</p><p>This as all pretty logical, but highly frustrating when you don’t know what’s going on. Samsung clearly has to do better.</p><h1 id=the-fix>The Fix</h1><p>Knowing what the issue is makes the fix pretty straight-forward.</p><p>Before starting your run, disable bluetooth on your smartphone, and wait for the Gear Fit 2 to register loss of the connection. It should vibrate on your wrist, and then show a little rectangle at the top right of the display, like this:<figure id=attachment_2749 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-2749 style=width:184px class="wp-caption alignnone"></p><p><img data-attachment-id=2749 data-permalink=https://cpbotha.net/2017/01/15/fixing-the-samsung-gear-fit-2-gps-lock-delay-when-running-without-phone/img_20170115_0925427/ data-orig-file=https://cpbotha.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_20170115_0925427.jpg data-orig-size=2250,3678 data-comments-opened=1 data-image-meta='{"aperture":"2.2","credit":"","camera":"PRIV","caption":"","created_timestamp":"1484472342","copyright":"","focal_length":"4.75","iso":"676","shutter_speed":"0.033333333333333","title":"","orientation":"1"}' data-image-title=IMG_20170115_0925427 data-image-description data-medium-file=https://cpbotha.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_20170115_0925427-184x300.jpg data-large-file=https://cpbotha.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_20170115_0925427-626x1024.jpg class="size-medium wp-image-2749" src=https://cpbotha.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_20170115_0925427-184x300.jpg alt width=184 height=300 srcset="https://cpbotha.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_20170115_0925427-184x300.jpg 184w, https://cpbotha.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_20170115_0925427-768x1255.jpg 768w, https://cpbotha.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_20170115_0925427-626x1024.jpg 626w, https://cpbotha.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_20170115_0925427-1200x1962.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 184px) 85vw, 184px"><figcaption id=caption-attachment-2749 class=wp-caption-text>Samsung Gear Fit 2 should recognise that it has lost connection with the phone, as shown by the rectangle at the top right.</figcaption></figure></p><p>You can now start the exercise app and then start your run.</p><p>This morning, my Gear Fit 2 acquired a GPS lock almost instantly. You can see this by <strong>the location icon which briefly flashes and then stays on</strong> (it’s very important that you ensure that it stays on before running off), and by the fact that the on-screen distance gauge (you only see the distance gauge if you have set a distance target) starts climbing immediately.</p><p>(Update: I’ve had more runs since. Sometimes the GPS struggles for half a minute or more to get a lock, with the location icon remaining in the flashing state. In these cases, I sometimes stop the run, and start over, until that damned flashing location icon goes stable. Frustrating.)</p><h1 id=samsung-gear-fit-2-even-casual-runners-should-think-twice>Samsung Gear Fit 2: Even casual runners should think twice.</h1><p>For the price, the Samsung Gear Fit 2 packs a lot of features.</p><p>However, between this undocumented (as far as I can see) and sometimes plain frustrating GPS behaviour, the voice guidance which breaks easily and mysteriously (see <a href=/2017/01/21/samsung-gear-fit-2-voice-guide-at-intervals-not-working-at-all-the-fix/>another post of mine on that issue and how to fix it</a>), and the battery life (a 40 minute run with music and GPS can use up 30% to 40% of the battery), slightly more serious casual runners (strange category, I know) might want to consider carefully their alternatives.</p></div><div class=article-toc><h3>Contents</h3><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#why-does-mygear-fit-2-take-so-long-to-acquirea-gps-lock>Why does my Gear Fit 2 take so long to acquire a GPS lock?</a></li><li><a href=#the-fix>The Fix</a></li><li><a href=#samsung-gear-fit-2-even-casual-runners-should-think-twice>Samsung Gear Fit 2: Even casual runners should think twice.</a></li></ul></nav></div><footer class=article-footer><ul class=article-tag-list><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/gadgets>gadgets</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/gps>gps</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/running>running</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/samsung>samsung</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/samsung-gear-fit-2>samsung gear fit 2</a></li></ul></footer></div><nav id=article-nav><a href=/2017/01/20/weekly-head-voices-114-so-you-know-what-i-did-last-summer/ id=article-nav-newer class=article-nav-link-wrap><div class=article-nav-title><span>&lt;</span>&nbsp;
