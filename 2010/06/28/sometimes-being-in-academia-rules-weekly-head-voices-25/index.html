            I took this photo of the Oude Kerk in Delft as we were taking a walk with one of our esteemed guests.

Time is really fun when you’re having flies.</p><p>Five of my MedVis (that’s <a href=http://graphics.tudelft.nl/Courses/in4307 title="MedVis IN4307 website">IN4307</a>; if you’re at the TU, make sure you take this life-changing course! :P ) students presented their final project work. Between the visualisations of coronary stents from optical coherence tomography data, the 3D lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) planning tool and the real-time X-Ray simulator, I was hugely and pleasantly impressed.  Expect to see a large part of this functionality in a future release of <a href=http://graphics.tudelft.nl/Projects/DeVIDE title="compulsory link to DeVIDE">DeVIDE</a>. This was energy-producing event #1 of the past two weeks. Energy-producing event #2 was a M.Sc. defence that I opposed just this past Friday, where the candidate presented and defended, in a highly-entertaining and convincing fashion, his thesis on investigating 3D synthetic aperture radar construction on multi-core architectures.</p><p>Energy-producing event #3 was when the now freshly minted <a href=http://graphics.tudelft.nl/~eric/ title="Eric Griffith's homepage">Dr Eric Griffith</a> defended his PhD thesis on <em><a href=http://graphics.tudelft.nl/Publications/Griffith2010 title="Link to Eric's PhD page">Visualizing Cumulus Clouds in Virtual Reality</a></em> in stellar fashion.  Dr Griffith did a superb job of maintaining an eloquent discussion with all 7 of his opponents. The offence of <a href=http://www.cs.rug.nl/~roe/ title="homepage Prof. Jos Roerdink">Prof Jos Roerdink</a> (Visualisation, Groningen) also deserves mention: The multi-level questions and typically professorial delivery were most entertaining.</p><p>The final energy-producing event that I’m going to mention has been named #4 for mysterious reasons, and, for other reasons that will soon become clear, was for me the most significant. <a href=http://graphics.tudelft.nl/~jorik/ title="Jorik's homepage">Jorik Blaas</a>, close collaborator and friend for the past seven (7!) years, defended his PhD on the <em><a href=http://graphics.tudelft.nl/Publications/Blaas2010 title="Link to Jorik's PhD page">Visual Analysis of Multi-Field Data</a></em>, on Thursday June 24. To take part in the offence, we were extremely honoured to welcome three <em>luminaries</em> of my research field (that’s Visualisation, for those of you who’ve just joined!): <a href=http://www.win.tue.nl/~vanwijk/ title="homepage Prof. Jack van Wijk">Prof.dr. Jack van Wijk</a>, <a href=http://www.itn.liu.se/~andyn/ title="homepage Prof.dr. Anders Ynnerman">Prof.dr. Anders Ynnerman</a> and the Viennese-Bergenesque <a href=http://www.ii.uib.no/vis/team/hauser/ title="homepage Prof.dr. Helwig Hauser">Prof.dr. Helwig Hauser</a>. Having all three of them in Delft was just <strong>WOW</strong>, you just have to trust me on this. In any case, for the first time at the TU, I was also allowed to take my place in the PhD committee. :)</p><p>Of course, Dr Blaas sailed through the defence, his usual understated yet verbally effective hyper-intelligent self. Invited lectures by our guests, much late night discussion on the nature of (visualisation) science and of life in general and finally a PhD party that stress-tested all glandular resilience helped to turn this into one seriously wonderful and life-affirming week. I am thankful to all involved.</p><p>In completely unrelated news:</p><ul><li>Have you ever wondered what that funnily isolated ‘J’ character is doing at the end of sentences in emails?  Well, <a href=http://chris.pirillo.com/j-smiley-outlook-email-problem-and-fix/ title="funny J in emails">wonder no more</a>! (5-second-version: it’s supposed to be a smiley, but Outlook on the sending side substitutes it with a character from the Wingdings font that is rendered at the receiving side, if that font is not available, as a ‘J’)</li><li>My 4-year old daughter recently made a drawing with two stick figures standing next to each other. Not significant as such, but the one stick figure was wearing a bow tie, while the other stick figure had a thought bubble above its head with a bow tie in it.</li></ul><p>Thank you for joining me again for this edition of the Weekly Head Voices, and please feel free to kick-off completely unrelated discussions in the comments.  Next week (actually this week, I’m late), four of us will be going to Leipzig for the bi-annual Eurographics workshop on <a href=http://vcbm.org/2010 title="EG VCBM 2010 website">Visual Computing for Biology and Medicine (VCBM)</a>, which I’ll probably be reporting on in a future blog post (and hopefully on twitter with hashtag <a href="http://twitter.com/search?q=%23vcbm2010" title="link to twitter hashtag #vcbm2010">#vcbm2010</a>). Stay tuned for much fun and excitement!</p></div><footer class=article-footer><ul class=article-tag-list><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/luminaries>luminaries</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/phd>phd</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/stick-figures>stick figures</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/visualisation>visualisation</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/visualization>visualization</a></li></ul></footer></div><nav id=article-nav><a href=/2010/07/08/vcbm-2010-weekly-head-voices-26/ id=article-nav-newer class=article-nav-link-wrap><div class=article-nav-title><span>&lt;</span>&nbsp; VCBM 2010 [Weekly Head Voices #26]</div></a><a href=/2010/06/19/eurovis-2010-weekly-head-voices-24/ id=article-nav-older class=article-nav-link-wrap><div class=article-nav-title>EuroVis 2010 [Weekly Head Voices #24]&nbsp;<span>></span></div></a></nav><div class=article-footer>Related posts:
