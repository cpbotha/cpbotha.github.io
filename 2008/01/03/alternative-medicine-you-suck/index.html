Those of you who understand Dutch can read this compact summary.
In short, sangomas (witch doctors) have a huge amount of sway with the local population. So when someone is infected with HIV and it manifests as AIDS, they go to the sangoma, who then coolly explains that they’re sick due to the interference of the spirits of their forefathers and claims that they know exactly how to remedy the problem (usually with some typically ineffective mystical ritual, also involving giving the patient lots of laxatives, thereby exacerbating the symptoms). The sangomas often actively discourage AIDS sufferers from going to the clinics where they would be treated with proven AIDS retardant drugs such as AZT."><meta property="og:type" content="website"><meta property="og:locale" content="en_US"><meta property="og:url" content="https://cpbotha.net/2008/01/03/alternative-medicine-you-suck/"><link rel="shortcut icon" href=/favicon.ico><link href=https://cpbotha.net/webfonts/ptserif/main.css rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link href=https://cpbotha.net/webfonts/source-code-pro/main.css rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Newsreader:ital,wght@0,400;0,700;1,400;1,700&family=Roboto:ital,wght@0,400;0,700;1,400;1,700&display=swap"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cpbotha.net/css/style.css><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.153.2"></head><body><div id=container><header id=header><div id=header-outer class=outer><div id=header-inner class=inner><a id=main-nav-toggle class=nav-icon href=javascript:;></a><a id=logo class=logo-text href=https://cpbotha.net/>voices in my head</a><nav id=main-nav><a class=main-nav-link href=/about/>About</a>

So when someone is infected with HIV and it manifests as AIDS, they go to the sangoma, who then coolly explains that they’re sick due to the interference of the spirits of their forefathers and claims that they know exactly how to remedy the problem (usually with some typically ineffective mystical ritual, also involving giving the patient lots of laxatives, thereby exacerbating the symptoms).

Let me rephrase that: they’re selfish idiots and they’re killing people. They should be prosecuted for obstructing conventional medicine.</p><p>To put this in context: a quarter of the South African population is HIV positive. Our minister of health, Dr. Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, believes that AIDS can be cured by <a href=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/5319680.stm title="Manto says, ">eating garlic and beetroot</a>. To add insult to injury, she has pulled strings to jump to the start of the liver transplant queue because she screwed up her own with <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manto_Tshabalala-Msimang title="Wikipedia article on Manto">alcohol abuse</a>.</p><p>Remember kids, if a treatment is not backed by evidence-based research, it’s probably bad for you, either directly, or due to effective inaction. The sangomas might be an extreme case, but in general, alternative medicine is to be handled with the greatest of suspicion.</p></div></div><nav id=article-nav><a href=/2008/01/08/soulwax/ id=article-nav-newer class=article-nav-link-wrap><div class=article-nav-title><span>&lt;</span>&nbsp; Soulwax</div></a><a href=/2008/01/02/iron-man-i-love-you/ id=article-nav-older class=article-nav-link-wrap><div class=article-nav-title>Iron Man, I love you&nbsp;<span>></span></div></a></nav></article><style>.isso-comment .avatar img{max-width:100%}.isso-comment>div.text-wrapper>div.text p{margin-top:1em}</style><script data-isso=/isso/cpbotha.net/ data-isso-reply-notifications=true data-isso-avatar=false data-isso-gravatar=true data-isso-max-comments-nested=inf data-isso-max-comments-top=inf data-isso-require-email=true data-isso-vote=false src=/isso/cpbotha.net/js/embed.min.js></script><section data-title="Alternative medicine, you suck" id=isso-thread></section></section><footer id=footer><div id=search-form-wrap><form class=search-form method=get action=https://duckduckgo.com/><input type=search name=q class=search-text placeholder title size=20 maxlength=128>
