VA87m mechanical keyboard</a> and that I was also quite surprised to learn that I
might prefer <em>linear</em> switches over <em>tactile</em>, thanks to the super smooth Cherry MX
Speed Silver switches.</p><p>Furthermore, its stabilisers were exceptionally smooth, and quiet. It taught me
that one did not have to live with rattly stabilisers.</p><p>As is often the case with new knowledge, this made me re-evaluate my
relationship with my other keyboard, the Womier K87 (aka &ldquo;RGB-with-unicorns&rdquo;),
which was introduced here in <a href=/2020/09/16/weekly-head-voices-204-what-is-your-purpose/#keyboard-update-unicorns-with-rgb>WHV #204</a>.</p><p>You see, that board came with both <em>tactile</em> switches (Gateron browns), and with
rattly <a href=https://switchandclick.com/stabilizer-guide/>stabilisers</a>.</p><p>&mldr; and so it came to pass that I ordered 90 Cherry MX Red switches from
<a href=https://www.ctrlshiftesc.co.za/>Ctrl.Shift.Esc</a>, as well as a super cheap (R109 when I ordered, it seems the
price has just doubled!) 100g tube of SPANJAARD silicone paste.</p><p>The red switches are quintessentially linear. They have a more conventional
actuation distance of 2mm versus the perhaps too-quick-for-me 1.2mm of the
speed silvers.</p><p>Plus, they were in stock.</p><p>I selected the SPANJAARD silicone paste as a cheap local alternative after
reading more than I ever wanted to know about lubricants and greases for
respectively the switches themselves and the stabilisers.</p><p>(I&rsquo;m just kidding, this is exactly the sort of thing I love knowing everything
about.)</p><p>On the evening of Monday, January 31, our dinner table looked like this:</p><figure><a href=womier-red-switches-in-progress.jpg><img sizes="(min-width: 35em) 1200px, 100vw" srcset='https://cpbotha.net/2022/02/09/weekly-head-voices-238-live-deep-and-suck-out-all-the-marrow-of-life/womier-red-switches-in-progress_hu06a89d3565099197aa98ca55e791c386_3364266_480x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 480w,

I kept those three browns top right for comparison. The white cap puller was much faster for me than the wire one above the keycaps.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Shortly after that, I was typing on the &ldquo;new&rdquo; board, entirely unconvinced that
the switch (haha) had been worthwhile.</p><p>As I&rsquo;m typing this, it&rsquo;s a more than a week later, and I am now entirely
convinced.</p><p>Based on how they feel, and an improvement of my typing speed and accuracy on
these switches relative to brown, I am hereby joining team linear!</p><p>With regard to the rattly stabs: On February 2 I removed the spacebar,
backspace and return keys, disassembled the stabilisers, and coated the wire
ends in as much silicone paste as I could. Although not quite at Varmilo
levels, the three respective stabilisers have improved massively, and have
convincingly crossed my satisfaction threshold.</p><h2 id=live-deep-and-suck-out-all-the-marrow-of-life>Live deep and suck out all the marrow of life</h2><p>I used to encourage friend PK, and probably others (and probably most often
just myself), but he usually just <em>got it</em>, with the following: &ldquo;Please remember
to squeeze out every last drop from that experience&rdquo;.</p><p>There was a distinctly visual, almost palpable, element to this wish.</p><p>You have to imagine somehow grabbing the moment in question, and then wringing
it out like a wet towel to extract every last iota of juicy experience.</p><p>As I&rsquo;m desperately scrambling here for the right words to describe precisely
the intention, you can image how happy I was to run into the following quote by
Henry David Thoreau just the other day:</p><blockquote><p>I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the
essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and
not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. I did not wish to live
what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practise resignation,
unless it was quite necessary. I wanted <strong>to live deep and suck out all the
marrow of life</strong>, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that
was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a
corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms&mldr; &ndash; Henry David Thoreau (<a href=https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/2690-i-went-to-the-woods-because-i-wished-to-live>ref</a>)</p></blockquote><p>(I just spent some time on <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_David_Thoreau>Thoreau&rsquo;s wikipedia page</a>. It turns out it was not
just this quote, he was an impressive human.)</p><p>Folks, remember to squeeze out every last drop from <em>your</em> experience!</p></div><div class=article-toc><h3>Contents</h3><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><ul><li><a href=#womier-k87-keyboard-customization-unlocked>Womier K87 keyboard: Customization unlocked!</a></li><li><a href=#live-deep-and-suck-out-all-the-marrow-of-life>Live deep and suck out all the marrow of life</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div><footer class=article-footer><ul class=article-tag-list><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/keyboards>keyboards</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/henry-david-thoreau>henry david thoreau</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/backyard-philosophy>backyard philosophy</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/vergelegen>vergelegen</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/gou>gou</a></li></ul></footer></div><nav id=article-nav><a href=/2022/03/01/weekly-head-voices-239-embarrassing-finitude/ id=article-nav-newer class=article-nav-link-wrap><div class=article-nav-title><span>&lt;</span>&nbsp;
