previous one, this one will simply engage in some excessive but pretty skillful
hand-waving and say that if you read it and the <a href=/2022/01/23/the-2021-to-2022-transition-post/>2021 to 2022 year transition
post</a>, you should be more or less up to date with the state of this nation up to
Sunday, January 30, 2022.</p><h2 id=eaz-and-sleep>EAZ and sleep</h2><p><a href=/tags/eaz/>EAZ (Experiment Alcohol Zero - no alcohol for at least a month but usually
more)</a> is still going strong, and it&rsquo;s getting harder for me to ignore the fact
that it&rsquo;s (again) having a drastic impact on my sleep quality.</p><p>Where I normally am quite chuffed to wake up feeling that I&rsquo;ve had a solid
night of sleep, these days it feels like I&rsquo;m almost guaranteed a great night of
shut-eye as long as I can get to bed on time.</p><h2 id=gou-updates>GOU updates</h2><p>In other much more important news, <a href=/about/weekly-head-voices-abbreviations/>GOU #1</a> has left the nest.</p><p>Ok fortunately only sort of&mldr; She now spends her weeks in the school&rsquo;s
dormitory.</p><p>They are extremely well looked-after, and she gets to participate even more
fully in school activities where previously this was a bit constrained by the 1
to 1.5 hour travel time (school bus in traffic) involved.</p><p>We do miss her quite a lot in the weeks.</p><p>In her absence, GOU #2 (2IC, IOW) has quickly taken on a new role, which is
interesting to see.</p><p>GOU #3 has just started with Grade R (first year of &ldquo;big school&rdquo;), and it looks
like she&rsquo;s taken to it like a fish to water.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a lot more fun now with both #2 and #3 in the car in the mornings,
although we could probably do without all the karma loss I suffer in traffic
every morning. The 4km from my house to school can easily take up to 25
minutes, during which I&rsquo;m obviously surrounded by people who clearly can&rsquo;t
drive.</p><h2 id=the-apple-doesn-t-fall-far-from-the-tree>The apple doesn&rsquo;t fall far from the tree</h2><p>At the start of 2019 I decided for some or other reason that I really wanted to
know how my branch of the Botha family connected to the rest of the tree.</p><p>Botha is a pretty common surname down here.</p><p>Many Botha&rsquo;s probably know that we are the descendants of <a href=https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Both-15>Friedrich Both</a>, a
soldier who came to the Cape from Wagenheim (from the Thuringen region of
Germany) in 1678 to assist the Dutch colonists.</p><p>OR ARE WE?</p><p><a href=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23948326/>A 2013 study by Greeff and Erasmus, titled <em>Appel Botha: The abc of a three
hundred year old divorce case</em></a>, showed that Theunis Botha, the first of four
sons of Friedrich Both and his Dutch wife, Maria Kickers (divorced from Jan
Cornelisz because they could not have children), was in fact the extra-marital
product of Maria&rsquo;s relationship with Ferdinandus Appel!</p><p>DUN DUN DUUUUUUUN!</p><p>According to the study, Theunis Appel is responsible for roughly half (38000) of all
of the Botha&rsquo;s (78000) living in 2013.</p><p>Returning to my branch all the way down here: My uncle E was so kind to send me
notes he made of the gravestones on one of the farms my ancestors lived on,
including full names and dates of birth and death of a number of said
ancestors. As you might realise, full names and birth / death dates are genealogy gold.</p><p>My aunt M&rsquo;s many stories helped to fill in any further gaps, especially by
confirming identities through matching full names with nick names.</p><p>Although initially I was unable to make the connection to the greater Botha
tree using this information, the <a href=https://www.myheritage.com/>MyHeritage</a> databases, and various bits of
information I could get from older clan members, I recently picked up my notes
again (after a two year hiatus!) and was suddenly able to make a single
high-impact connection (my great-great-grandfather) that I previously missed.</p><p>Long story short, the moment I did this all of the fragments came together, and
I&rsquo;m now able to say with reasonable confidence that <a href=https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Appel-29>Ferdinandus Appel</a> and <a href=https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Kickers-1>Maria
Kickers</a> are my great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandparents.</p><p>DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUUN!</p><h2 id=i-don-t-want-to-step-over-the-thing>I don&rsquo;t want to step over the thing</h2><p>At the end of their <a href=https://lexfridman.com/sam-harris/>3 hour long podcast interview from May</a>, Lex Fridman asks
Sam Harris one of his standard questions (you can listen to the bit in question
<a href="https://youtu.be/4dC_nRYIDZU?t=11241">precisely here</a>):</p><blockquote><p>What is the meaning of life?</p></blockquote><p>In almost typical Sam Harris fashion, he replies that it&rsquo;s the wrong question.</p><p>Less cryptically, Sam explains that if you&rsquo;re searching for that mythical
<em>meaning of life</em> that&rsquo;s going to make everything better, you might be doing it
wrong.</p><p>In his words (which I have transcribed and cleaned up a little bit especially
for you):</p><blockquote><p>You don&rsquo;t have to live with the illusion anymore that you need a good enough
reason and that things are going to get better when you do get those reasons.</p><p>There&rsquo;s a mirage-like quality to every future attainment and every future
breakthrough and every future peak experience that eventually you get the
lesson that you never quite arrive.</p><p><strong>You don&rsquo;t arrive until you cease to step over the present moment in search of
the next thing.</strong></p><p><strong>We&rsquo;re constantly stepping over the thing that we think we&rsquo;re seeking in the
act of seeking it.</strong> [ed: my emphasis. I loved this bit]</p><p>&mldr;</p><p>You can&rsquo;t actually become happy. You can only be happy.</p></blockquote><p>His words hit home for me.</p><p>Dear readers, I truly wish you an abundance of recognizing the thing, and of
<em>being</em> happy.</p></div><div class=article-toc><h3>Contents</h3><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><ul><li><a href=#eaz-and-sleep>EAZ and sleep</a></li><li><a href=#gou-updates>GOU updates</a></li><li><a href=#the-apple-doesn-t-fall-far-from-the-tree>The apple doesn&rsquo;t fall far from the tree</a></li><li><a href=#i-don-t-want-to-step-over-the-thing>I don&rsquo;t want to step over the thing</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div><footer class=article-footer><ul class=article-tag-list><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/backyard-philosophy>backyard philosophy</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/eaz>eaz</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/lex-fridman>lex fridman</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/sam-harris>sam harris</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/sleep>sleep</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/gou>gou</a></li></ul></footer></div><nav id=article-nav><a href=/2022/02/09/weekly-head-voices-238-live-deep-and-suck-out-all-the-marrow-of-life/ id=article-nav-newer class=article-nav-link-wrap><div class=article-nav-title><span>&lt;</span>&nbsp;
