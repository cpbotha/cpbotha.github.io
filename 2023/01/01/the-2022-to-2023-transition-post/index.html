in its turn attracted just over 147 thousand unique visitor IPs over the year.</p><p>The most popular posts from vxlabs were the following, in descending order:</p><ul><li><a href=https://vxlabs.com/2022/06/12/typescript-development-with-emacs-tree-sitter-and-lsp-in-2022/>TypeScript development with Emacs, tree-sitter and LSP in 2022</a> - with

selection of learnings that bear mention in this yearly overview.</p><p>Because I think all of them are worthy of a retrospection, they are
chronologically ordered.</p><ul><li><a href=/2022/02/03/weekly-head-voices-237-dont-step-over-the-thing/#i-don-t-want-to-step-over-the-thing>WHV #237 Don&rsquo;t step over the thing</a> &ndash; <em>We’re constantly stepping over the thing that
we think we’re seeking in the act of seeking it.</em> &mldr; <em>You can’t actually
become happy. You can only be happy.</em><ul><li>Related: <a href=/2022/11/01/weekly-head-voices-247-precious-moments/#take-a-picture-with-your-mind>WHV #247 Take a picture with your mind</a> &ndash; Your narrating self, the
one that needs to take all of those photos, can also take you out of the
thing.</li></ul></li><li><a href=/2022/03/01/weekly-head-voices-239-embarrassing-finitude/#the-rickety-raft-of-life-directions-and-priorities>WHV #239 Embarrassing finitude</a> &ndash; I&rsquo;m going to summarise that post section
here with &ldquo;pick your battles&rdquo;, or for the more poetically inclined readers
&ldquo;choose your f*cks&rdquo;. Our time is extremely limited - it is best to make
extremely deliberate and economical choices about the things that we spend
our time and energy on at any point.</li><li><a href=/2022/05/23/weekly-head-voices-242-multiplicity-of-me/>WHV #242 Multiplicity of me</a> &ndash; If you skip everything else, read this
one. It&rsquo;s like &ldquo;happiness for dummies, in 24 hours&rdquo;.</li><li><a href=/2022/06/23/weekly-head-voices-243-part-time-role-model/#part-time--role--model>WHV #243 Part-time role model</a> &ndash; Some motivation to never stop trying to be the
best you, also when, inevitably, you&rsquo;ll only have occasional success.</li><li><a href=/2022/09/25/weekly-head-voices-246-call-up-your-friends/#call-up-your-friends>WHV #246 Call up your friends</a> &ndash; Do call up that friend you&rsquo;re thinking
up. Write thank-you notes. Send birthday messages. Make the connection!</li><li><a href=/2022/11/20/weekly-head-voices-249-self-discipline/#self-discipline>WHV #249 Self-discipline</a> &ndash; Take care of this personal engine and it will
take you places.</li><li><a href=/2022/12/06/weekly-head-voices-250-durable-blissful-contentment/#happiness-is-a-joke>WHV #250 Durable, blissful contentment</a></li></ul><h3 id=quo-vadis-2023>Quo vadis 2023</h3><p>Writing on this here blog, and specifically the WHVs, is important to me for
the following reasons:</p><ul><li>They enable learning, through retro- and introspection.</li><li>Each successful post is an exercise in applied and externalised self-discipline.</li><li>I enjoy practising the dying art of writing.</li><li>They help to form a connection with other humans, both friends and strangers.</li></ul><p>The reason for this retro-retrospection here, is that I am evaluating the
(smouldering) results and implications of the tension between post regularity
on the one hand, and self-perceived post substance on the other, over the past
year.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve erred on the side of post substance, when regularity might have been the
better option.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not that I was able to control it that deftly; what we have here is merely
the result of trying to publish posts of a reasonable quality at a reasonable
cadence.</p><p>My current feeling is that I would like to increase regularity, in spite of
past performance.</p><p>To make this happen, I have to learn to be satisfied with somewhat less, and
more importantly, I have to come up with improvements to my blogging workflow
that enable a more predictable flow of material.</p><p>A new year won&rsquo;t be a true new year without overly ambitious resolutions, now
will it?</p><h2 id=running>Running</h2><p>This year, I averaged 20km of running per week for a total of 1044km (118 runs,
just under 99 hours) over the whole year.</p><p>Last year I did 25km per week, which is what I would have liked for this year
as well, but this is fine. <em>Any</em> kilometres are better than no kilometres!</p><figure><img sizes="(min-width: 35em) 1200px, 100vw" srcset='https://cpbotha.net/2023/01/01/the-2022-to-2023-transition-post/images/Tasks/2022-12-31_16-17-19_screenshot_hua32545cc66be13d0a43b81fe5cb74757_125351_480x0_resize_box_3.png 480w,

any specific reasons for the low / no-exercise weeks, but nothing jumped out.</p><p>I&rsquo;m going to have to blame work for this one too.</p><p>Anyways, what I <em>can</em> say, without any hesitation, is that running made a massive
positive contribution to my physical and mental well-being this year.</p><p>The effects can generally be immediately felt (that beautiful bit when it feels
like all one&rsquo;s limbs are finally working together, rhythmically even, is
exhilarating), and usually signal another start of a cascade of positive
physiological and life-style factors.</p><p>Running resolutions for 2023: 0) Much enjoy. 1) Don&rsquo;t get injured. 2) Try <em>again</em> for the 25km/w average.</p><h2 id=reading>Reading</h2><p>I really enjoyed the following books:</p><h3 id=fiction>Fiction</h3><ul><li><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54906250-project-hail-mary>Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir</a> - feel good edge of seat stranded in space but

habit</a>.</p><p>I plan to reinstate this habit, and to install the new habit of reading more
books on my phone (vs being limited to my Kindle, which is not always with me).</p><p>Armed with these two life-hacks, I hope to finish reading 20 books in 2023.</p><p>Please send me your recommendations in the comments below!</p><h2 id=systems-and-tools-for-running-this-human>Systems and tools for running this human</h2><p>As per tradition, I quote from previous transition posts my explanation of &ldquo;The
System&rdquo;:</p><blockquote><p>The System is Emacs, and orgmode, and multi-scalar note-taking everywhere, and
sketching, and daily habits, and a whole bag of tricks to try and keep this
creaky old frame moving in the right direction.</p></blockquote><p>Similar to <a href=/2022/01/23/the-2021-to-2022-transition-post/#systems-and-tools-for-running-this-human--pkm-baby>last year</a>, Emacs, Orgmode and Org-roam are still going very strong,
and constitute the lion&rsquo;s share of my personal knowledge management system.</p><p>In fact, with the imminent Emacs 29 release, a recent build of which I&rsquo;m typing
this draft into (English is hard folks&mldr;), Emacs has only become <em>more</em>
compelling.</p><p>Amongst <a href=https://blog.phundrak.com/emacs-29-what-can-we-expect>many other improvements</a>, tree-sitter, eglot and use-package are now all
part of core.</p><h3 id=byeeeeee-dropbox>Byeeeeee Dropbox!</h3><p>However&mldr;</p><p>The time has finally come for me to drop (again) Dropbox.</p><p>Although I have been a paying customer for many years (see <a href=/2010/02/28/weekly-head-voices-15-auto-tune-my-cloud/>WHV #15</a> from
February of 2010 for a report close to the start of our commercial
relationship), in the end it was their intransigence and inscrutability around
the Dropbox Paper 2020 migration that broke the camel&rsquo;s back.</p><p>They have been promising since before 2020 that they would migrate all existing
users to the new 2020 edition of Dropbox Paper.</p><p>However, now all you can find about this are frustrated forum posts from
long-time customers. My direct support request to be migrated was promptly
answered, and then closed with the following message:</p><blockquote><p>As much as I would like to help, currently, the latest version of Paper release
is available to new users only.</p><p>Our team is currently in the process of working on this new feature in order to
build the best Paper experience for all our users.</p></blockquote><p>I still really love that tool (winner of the WHV Award for the Most
Unexpectedly Useful Software Tool of the Year 2021!), but the interaction above
only served as a reminder of the pitfalls of a relationship like this.</p><p>During the writing of my yet-to-appear 202x note-taking approach blog post, it
bugged me that I had to come up with a good explanation for why I allowed
Dropbox Paper to break my rule of everything-needs-to-be-a-file-I-could-sync.</p><p>Although my yearly Dropbox Paper subscription is only up for renewal in June of
&lsquo;23, I decided to bite the bullet and <a href=/2022/11/11/weekly-head-voices-248-oh-snap/#hell-freezes-over--again>migrate everything out to an extremely
frightening mix of OneDrive, syncthing and unison</a>.</p><p>As I write this, it&rsquo;s been just over two months with nary a hiccup.</p><p>In June, I&rsquo;ll let that Dropbox subscription lapse.</p><p>Dropbox Paper, RIP.</p><p>(With <a href=https://1writerapp.com/>1writer</a> and also <a href=https://plainorg.com/>Plain Org</a> on the iPhone, and <a href=https://syncthing.net/>syncthing</a> on my main desktop
at home, plus Apple Notes for the truly ephemeral stuff, I have a pretty
capable mobile response to Paper.)</p><h3 id=resolutions>Resolutions</h3><ol><li>I would really like to publish a blog post titled <em>Note-taking approach

Ideally, it should be full of information about my current PKM system.</li><li>Write more notes, including both journals and <a href=/tags/zettelkasten/>Zettelkasten-style</a> notes.</li><li>Stretch goal: Maybe get another useful patch into Emacs.</li></ol><h2 id=work>Work</h2><p>2022 was my first year back in employment, after <a href=/2013/03/09/dear-academia-i-hope-we-can-still-be-friends/>eight years of freelancing</a>.</p><p>In this year, I have only become more deeply involved and invested in the
current <a href=https://stonethree.com/>Stone Three</a> adventure.</p><p>As I mentioned previously, I have the privilege of working closely together
with extremely capable folks, in a high-trust setting.</p><p>Many of my colleagues are smarter than I am in their respective fields. Due to
that, and the fact that we are both growing and innovating, I am constantly
learning.</p><p>My personal responsibilities span the spectrum from programming, through
mentor- and leadership to management and org-level technical decisions. On the
other dimension, I am exposed to everything from software plumbing to data
science, engineering and visualization. (This is what&rsquo;s known as a
PiM-situation. PiM = pig in mud)</p><p>The work is hard, but it&rsquo;s varied, it&rsquo;s challenging, it&rsquo;s together with a group
of humans I like, and it feels meaningful.</p><p>I have written all these words to try and explain that although it&rsquo;s clear from
this post that Work(tm) took up significantly more time and space this year, it
has contributed substantially to my well-being.</p><p>Freelancing was less stressful &ndash; I could focus on the engineering tasks at
hand and usually deliver. Now I have more responsibility, which brings
substantially more stress but also more satisfaction.</p><p>Furthermore, in terms of maintaining the plasticity of my neural network,
something I do have to pay more and more attention to thanks to the advancing
years, the variation and challenges of my current work setting are great.</p><p>That being said, I definitely have to get better at controlling stress.</p><h2 id=things-i-would-like-to-work-on-in-2023>Things I would like to work on in 2023</h2><p>In addition to the blogging, running, reading and systems resolutions mentioned
above, I would like to work on the following bigger themes in 2023:</p><ol><li>Work(tm).</li><li>Self-discipline, <a href=/2022/11/20/weekly-head-voices-249-self-discipline/#self-discipline>as featured in WHV #249</a>. I will implement this by writing
really stern messages to me in my diary.</li><li>Creating, restoring and maintaining good habits that <a href=/tags/compounding/>compound</a>: Reading,
writing, running, mindfulness practice.</li></ol><p>&mldr; and then finally, my central theme for 2023 will be:</p><h3 id=4-dot-expansiveness>4. Expansiveness</h3><p>Sometimes, most probably when you&rsquo;re out in nature, you experience your senses
really opening up.</p><p>It is as if the usually clearly defined borders between you and your
surroundings start to fade away.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve talked about this phenomenon before, in <a href=/2021/03/22/weekly-head-voices-217-consciousness-continuum/#the-strange-continuum-of-consciousness>WHV #217&rsquo;s The Strange Continuum
of Consciousness</a> and in other places.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a great feeling, and it usually happens when you are fully present in that
