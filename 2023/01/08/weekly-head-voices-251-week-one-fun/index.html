The weather was amazing.</p></figcaption></figure><p>You might recall from the 2023 transition post that appeared a mere week ago,
that <a href=/2023/01/01/the-2022-to-2023-transition-post/#quo-vadis-2023>I really wanted to try to post more regularly here</a>, even if it meant that
the posts might be less substantial.</p><p>Well here we are: A short post that is on time!</p><p>(The proposed blogging pipeline improvements that were also mentioned are still in progress (AKA I have
not yet started).)</p><h2 id=gou-1-is-back-from-dot-de>GOU #1 is back from .de!</h2><p>The biggest news of the week is that GOU #1 has returned from a month-long
<a href=https://fsa-youthexchange.co.za/>FSA exchange</a> visit to Essen, in Germany.</p><p>We really missed her, but she&rsquo;s back after an experience-packed four weeks with
an amazing host family, living her best life as she has this obvious talent to
do.</p><h2 id=a-tonne-of-fun-in-week-one>A tonne of fun in week one</h2><p>Due to possibly debatable life decisions, I returned to work on Monday,
January 3.</p><p>There are perks to starting up so early in the year, primarily that it&rsquo;s quite
peaceful, and there&rsquo;s a bit more headspace than normal to think about bigger
plans for the year ahead.</p><p>Sadly, I have not yet made any break-throughs in this regard.</p><p>Partially this is due to a substantial number of my mental cycles having to go
into a data-science project that requires my attention, and partially because I
have not yet taken that deep-thinking-walk.</p><p>I&rsquo;ll get on that walk tomorrow!</p><p>In spite of work, we did manage to fit in a whole bunch of fun in this first
week:</p><ul><li>We squeezed in a sneaky but sublime school night sunset dinner at Millhouse
Kitchen on Lourensford Farm to celebrate our anticipation of GOU #1&rsquo;s return
the next day.</li><li>We made a family outing of a trip to the V&amp;A Waterfront on Saturday to return
an Adoozy powerbank that they saved abovementioned GOU&rsquo;s phone with at OR
Tambo airport in Johannesburg. Their rental powerbank concept looks
interesting, and the people were really super helpful, but their network in
Cape Town is a bit anaemic with the main issue that you can&rsquo;t return your
powerbank at Cape Town airport!<ul><li>During this outing, we had lunch at <a href=https://denanker.co.za/>Den Anker</a> where we always enjoy
culinary and cultural echoes of our other home. In my case, this includes
the taste of my favourite Trappist beer, namely <a href=/tags/rochefort/>the Rochefort</a>. On this
beautiful sunny day, I opted for and limited myself to the lighter #6. (I
and some of my friends have been known to enjoy all of those even numbers
in sequence.)</li></ul></li><li>On Sunday, we (famjam) made use of the absolutely fabulous weather and spent
a glorious day in Betty&rsquo;s Bay, mostly on its main beach. I&rsquo;m currently
reading <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43263225-supernova-era>Liu
Cixin&rsquo;s Supernova Era</a> and the story, with its pretty inventive premise, has
just switched up a few gears.<ul><li>The ocean views from <a href=/2017/01/20/weekly-head-voices-114-so-you-know-what-i-did-last-summer/>Clarence Drive</a> were truly breath-taking today. They
were so over-the-top beautiful that GOU #1 exclaimed at least once that
they &ldquo;look like a rendering&rdquo;, which struck me as a really remarkable
compliment. (This was followed by some joking in the car about all of <em>this</em>
<a href=https://www.simulation-argument.com/>being a simulation</a>.)</li></ul></li></ul><p>Have a great week friends, I hope to see you again on the other side!</p></div><div class=article-toc><h3>Contents</h3><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><ul><li><a href=#gou-1-is-back-from-dot-de>GOU #1 is back from .de!</a></li><li><a href=#a-tonne-of-fun-in-week-one>A tonne of fun in week one</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div><footer class=article-footer><ul class=article-tag-list><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/beer>beer</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/bettys-bay>betty's bay</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/rochefort>rochefort</a></li></ul></footer></div><nav id=article-nav><a href=/2023/04/11/note-taking-strategy-2023/ id=article-nav-newer class=article-nav-link-wrap><div class=article-nav-title><span>&lt;</span>&nbsp; Note-taking strategy 2023</div></a><a href=/2023/01/01/the-2022-to-2023-transition-post/ id=article-nav-older class=article-nav-link-wrap><div class=article-nav-title>The 2022 to 2023 transition post&nbsp;<span>></span></div></a></nav><div class=article-footer>Related posts:
