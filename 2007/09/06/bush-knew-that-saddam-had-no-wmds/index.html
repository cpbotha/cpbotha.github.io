It turns out that Bush knew all along that Saddam had absolutely no WMDs, but that the decision had already been made to invade Iraq, and that the intelligence was simply twisted to fit this policy.

Read all the nasty details in <a href="http://www.salon.com/opinion/blumenthal/2007/09/06/bush_wmd/?source=whitelist" title="Salon article ">this Salon article</a>. Here’s a choice excerpt:</p><p><em>On April 23, 2006, CBS’s “60 Minutes” interviewed Tyler Drumheller, the former CIA chief of clandestine operations for Europe, who disclosed that the agency had received documentary intelligence from Naji Sabri, Saddam’s foreign minister, that Saddam did not have WMD. “We continued to validate him the whole way through,” said Drumheller. “The policy was set. The war in Iraq was coming, and they were looking for intelligence to fit into the policy, to justify the policy.”</em></p><p><em>Now two former senior CIA officers have confirmed Drumheller’s account to me and provided the background to the story of how the information that might have stopped the invasion of Iraq was twisted in order to justify it. They described what Tenet said to Bush about the lack of WMD, and how Bush responded, and noted that Tenet never shared Sabri’s intelligence with then Secretary of State Colin Powell. According to the former officers, the intelligence was also never shared with the senior military planning the invasion, which required U.S. soldiers to receive medical shots against the ill effects of WMD and to wear protective uniforms in the desert.</em></p><p>This was brought under my attention by <a href=http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/ title="Pharyngula blog.">Pharyngula</a>, a brilliant science-blog that you should definitely add to your aggregator. Oh by the way, it has an ever-so-slight militantly atheistic tone, but that only makes it better.</p></div></div><nav id=article-nav><a href=/2007/09/26/ati2evxx-is-evil-bad_pool_caller-evil/ id=article-nav-newer class=article-nav-link-wrap><div class=article-nav-title><span>&lt;</span>&nbsp;
