started the morning (and the work week!) with stupid indecision: Had all my work gear in the car, but chose to drive back home after dropping of GOU#3 for a logistical task which one of my other clan members would gladly have taken care of.

Indecision irrelevant against the backdrop: We had such a good time in the car first being on time (GOU#3 loves that), then listening to Skrillex together, then talking, and then performing our morning ritual of verbally attesting our super-infinite love for each other as I drop her off at school.


During highly technical demo outside of my domains, used perplexity in real-time to lookup various details as the demo was going on, and thus could focus on the really interesting questions for the presenter.
Between meetings, struggled a bit to focus in the focusy bits, but managed to do quite a bit of work eventually (with focusapp and some deep house) and even got milestones done.

Super frustrated during the morning rush, because could not find running shoes at the critical moment when we had to leave for school

Reverted to backup shoes (old ones, with too many kilometres on them)
Good run in L&amp;Z, but it took so  long to disconnect from my shoe moment, in spite of really putting my mind to it. Succeeded a little bit at the end, shocked at the mental cost of something this trivial.
BTW, it was almost a textbook &ldquo;not inside it&rsquo;s on top!&rdquo; situation.

For once some Waking Up in the morning! (I once had a streak of more than a year. Currently happy if I do just one!)
Started the day in pensive mood (before and after the meditation) thinking about what I would like from the future

Naturally I wanted to write a note, so then I tapped out a topic in the daily list so that I could use org-roam-node-find-similar to surface similar notes from the past. I did find the correct historic note which I would not have otherwise, but then I got sucked into emacs config&mldr;

why has my org-roam-node-find-* never done live preview like other consult commands? &ndash; solved by installing https://github.com/jgru/consult-org-roam/tree/main and then tooting about it: https://emacs.ch/@cpbotha/112008312753264000

During the day I was surprised at the amount of traction that toot got. It seems there are more people who missed this. It seems it can sometimes really help to share the minutiae.


realised that org-roam-node-find-similar did not sort the similar nodes by similarity, so fixed that: https://github.com/cpbotha/org-roam-similarity/commit/d940c12e70468adfbc1e41ef997c5f797540ebf7


After extricating myself back out of Emacs config yak shaving, I did spend some quality time writing up my thoughts, helping to clarify them.

I don&rsquo;t know the answer yet, but the direction I&rsquo;m moving in feels good.




Lunch with inner circle friend and mentor DMW at No Way Jose was great thank you!

Thursday 2024-02-29

Run at shortly after 7. Legs did not really want to cooperate.
Got distracted by meetings day at work, so almost no writing in the daily. Now, [2024-03-10 Sun 18:35], I&rsquo;m really sorry.

Friday 2024-03-01

Pool repair at my house. They are able to pump out all water, repair floor of pool, then pump all water back all in a few hours.
I have two ideas for the weekend

Build and publish a QRCode contact card generator using marimo and wasm
build a telegram bot to manipulate my org-mode database, e.g. adding tasks, searching for existing tasks and notes.

I don&rsquo;t like this second idea, but it keeps on coming back to me.





Saturday 2024-03-02

12km run with tired legs, so tired that I decided to stop the fast and get Powerade for the last 5km, which felt like it really helped.
Super happy that I could get the promised marimo-wasm-qrcode generator online: https://vxlabs.com/2024/03/02/contact-qrcode-generator-with-marimo-and-wasm/

Sunday 2024-03-03

After sunday morning coffee and scrolling, dug into marimo to see if there&rsquo;s some way to create the WASM locally. There does not seem to be.
Scanned through https://core.telegram.org/bots to see (again&mldr;) what might be possible.
Actually, now I&rsquo;m thinking about the idea of making a telegram bot that sends me random tasks from my org-mode every day. I already have a proof of concept in Python that uses emacsclient to expose org-roam nodes via API (see https://github.com/cpbotha/org-roam-canvas ) so I would probably follow a similar path, probably with something like org-ql. Does anyone know if something like this exists somewhere?

Apple&rsquo;s Journal app, that suggests a new journalling possibility now and then, made me think that this could help.


In iTerm2, press the Option-Cmd keys together to make a rectangular selection.
Sublime lunch at Millhouse Kitchen with inner circle family
Back home, tried to get MobileOrg going again; looked promising, but then after successful sync ran into this bug with empty outlines in the app when synced via iCloud. 😥
Configured perplexity via gptel in my Emacs; I am especially interested in using perplexity&rsquo;s sonar-online internet-capable models.
