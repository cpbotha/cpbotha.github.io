As GOU#1 and GOU#2 were busy leaving for school, #3 came in to #2 for a hug but #2 was a bit too focused on getting all of her things ready to go in the car. Good Charl, in his only appearance of the day, spontaneously interjected with: &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re in a hug, for that moment, you put your full attention into that hug. For that moment, nothing else exists but the hug.&rdquo;. I could really see the message hitting home with #2, and she vocalised as much. Monday: BIG SUCCESS!
At work, managed to spill black coffee all over meself as I was just doing step 1 of living the one cable dream (read: attaching usb-c cable to my macbook). Clumsy Charl clearly at the wheel&mldr;
Short but really nice streamlit demo during a work meeting. I knew about streamlit, but I&rsquo;ve never actually played with it.
Spent the rest of the day fighting trying, without success, to update the webcola d3 adapter to the latest version of d3.

In bed that night, had light-bulb that React was probably a better solution for this visualization in any case&mldr;
&mldr; and then realised that few years back I built something similar for work, and had a similar evolution of ideas which ended up with react + webcola.



Tuesday 2024-01-23

At the office nice and early (7:30).
Chatted with colleague about the abovementioned React + webcola thing we worked on together, at which point he pointed me at react-flow and comfyui

react-flow looks like it could work pretty well for this new project. Also: SO SHINY!


streamlit app life cycle: script re-runs every time user interacts, see https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started/fundamentals/summary

it does have caching mechanisms to make this go faster
marimo, although much newer, approaches this issue with its reactive cell pattern


Idea: We should write focused technical memos at work. This is now howto, but rather &ldquo;things I learned&rdquo; formulated to teach not just to document.
Upgaded phone to iOS 17.3 and MacBook to macOS 14.3. Apparently there&rsquo;s a zero day vulnerability in previous versions that can be exploited via malicious websites.

Wednesday 2024-01-24

8km run at just after 7 AM before it really got hot
dip in the pool (friend LM says we must but pool is probably not cold enough due to +30℃ temps), then started to work
right after dip in pool, partially pulled back muscle. Partial, because two warning spasms, but not complete lock like many previous times. PHEW!

Remember kids: Our spine&rsquo;s vertical operation is a major evolutionary hack job and a mechanical disaster just waiting to happen. My advice: Spend more time horizontally.
This is also the reason why I&rsquo;m still searching for a long enough reclining chair.


Lovely working lunch with friend S at No Way José
Some random ideas that popped into my head as I was trying to work:

idea: make github so that people can pipx install marimo-turbo to get install with pandas, altair, matplotlib, and so on.
idea: figure out way to publish marimo dashboard to HTTPS url somewhere, for really really cheap

sounds like AWS API gateway + lambdas can do something complicated to host streamlit, which also uses websockets
in the end, probably better to do this on my own VPS

&mldr; or even better, on my own machine behind tailscale funnel! This was straight-forward and seems to work well. See https://emacs.ch/@cpbotha/111811547009420844 (post is also embedded below)




idea: (which has been active for a bit longer) A reliable pattern to lazy start upstream processes only when the first request comes in, and to stop them when no-one is connected. Client -> nginx -> supervisord -> tornado

systemd can partially do something like this using socket activation: https://serverfault.com/questions/1121584/start-apache-on-demand-using-systemd-socket-activation
I would prefer to use supervisord for this
This will remain on the todo list for now, unless one of you knows a trick?




ran into dude who built kubernetes thing for Hetzner using Crystal, a programming language of which I remembered that it just had a release, so quickly lost some more time on &ldquo;crystal vs nim-lang&rdquo; googling

I&rsquo;ll live, probably consoled by just such a Jonkersweiss.
