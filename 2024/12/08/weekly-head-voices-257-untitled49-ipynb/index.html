            The view right from our lunch table at Stellenbosch Reserve, Haskell Vineyard
        


Haskell vineyard has made previous appearances on this blog in WHV #99 in 2015, in WHV #181 in 2019 and perhaps in other posts.

In the case of AoC, you get unadulterated puzzle solving, and none of the other complications of writing production software.</p></blockquote><p>The dark side of that property is that as the puzzles get more difficult and take up increasing amounts of time, the cat nip enjoyer can get locked in and have great difficulty even noticing that they are spending hours every day writing computer programmes when at first other people are working and later, down here, they are outside enjoying their summer vacation.</p><p>In 2020, I think it was on day 21 that I noticed after more than four hours on that day&rsquo;s puzzle that it was probably time to put down the keyboard.</p><p>Since then I have been carefully enjoying the first few days of each year&rsquo;s AoC, taking care to walk away when the cat nip becomes too strong.</p><p>This year I had resolved not to take part at all, as there are a number of important work projects and personal obligations to take care of.</p><p>However, my resolve broke on the first day when I thought &ldquo;What could be the harm in just taking a little peek?&rdquo;. That little peek led to a little solution, and then another, and then another day, and so on.</p><p>Anyways, as you can see from my <a href="https://bsky.app/hashtag/AdventOfCode?author=charlbotha.com">#AdventOfCode tagged posts on Bluesky</a>, I am not officially taking part, I&rsquo;m just submitting solutions every day.</p><p>On a more serious note: I am happy not to miss out on the AoC loads of fun, especially the banter and comparisons and learning on various chat groups, but I am really trying to keep a critical eye on the daily time expense. If it gets out of hand, I will walk away from the programmer cat nip.</p><p>P.S. Today was particularly fun, precisely because I managed to squeeze the puzzle in between more important activities. The little rush when I submitted part 2&rsquo;s solution minutes before we had to leave for lunch was exquisite.</p><blockquote class=bluesky-embed data-bluesky-uri=at://did:plc:oy5vmr2vnff6yxs65hwgk5xq/app.bsky.feed.post/3lcsengeop22r data-bluesky-cid=bafyreic3sip7ko7ice6gssjd5e57i7l7mbzkghwzp6dy24bee3m2texiza><p lang=en>Today I was planning on extra vigorously NOT taking part in AoC because it's Sunday: planning a long run followed by lunch with some of our best friends.<p>Plans all happened, but in between I completed "Resonant Collinearity" - Day 8 - Advent of Code 2024 #AdventOfCode adventofcode.com/2024/day/8<br><br><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:oy5vmr2vnff6yxs65hwgk5xq/post/3lcsengeop22r?ref_src=embed">[image or embed]</a></p>— Charl P.

Whilst this certainly reduces the error surface, it&rsquo;s not as robust as editing the markdown directly, which I&rsquo;m doing right now.</p><p>Thanks for coming to my TED talk.</p><h2 id=on-waiting>On waiting</h2><blockquote><p>There&rsquo;s no such thing as waiting &ndash; only unexpected extra time to practice being present. &ndash; <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Chozen_Bays>Jan Chozen Bays</a></p></blockquote><p>P.S. In American English, practice is used both as verb and as noun, unlike British English which uses practice as a noun, and practise as the verb. Dr Bays is American, so I&rsquo;m keeping the spelling.</p></div><div class=article-toc><h3>Contents</h3><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><ul><li><a href=#why-im-definitely-not-taking-part-in-advent-of-code-2024>Why I&rsquo;m definitely not taking part in Advent of Code 2024</a></li><li><a href=#webp-ftw>WebP FTW</a></li><li><a href=#why-im-starting-to-write-these-more-regularly-in-hugo-vs-orgmode>Why I&rsquo;m starting to write these more regularly in Hugo vs Orgmode</a></li><li><a href=#on-waiting>On waiting</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div><footer class=article-footer><ul class=article-tag-list><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/advent-of-code>advent of code</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/emacs>emacs</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/haskell>haskell</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/hugo>hugo</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/orgmode>orgmode</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/webp>webp</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/stellenbosch>stellenbosch</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/haskell>haskell</a></li></ul></footer></div><nav id=article-nav><a href=/2024/12/19/weekly-head-voices-258-kogelberg-25/ id=article-nav-newer class=article-nav-link-wrap><div class=article-nav-title><span>&lt;</span>&nbsp; Weekly Head Voices #258: Kogelberg 25</div></a><a href=/2024/11/24/weekly-head-voices-256-word/ id=article-nav-older class=article-nav-link-wrap><div class=article-nav-title>Weekly Head Voices #256: Word&nbsp;<span>></span></div></a></nav><div class=article-footer>Related posts:
