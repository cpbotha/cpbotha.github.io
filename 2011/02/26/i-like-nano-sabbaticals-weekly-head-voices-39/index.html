It turns out other people call their week-long sabbaticals <em>nano</em> too. Â Durn. In any case, as you will recall I also went away on a [month-long micro-sabbatical in 2009][2], but this time I wanted to experiment with spending almost a whole work-week focusing on a single task, trying to finish a [survey article][3] Iâ€™ve been working on for almost two years. The week is now over and the article is not ready for submission yet, but it <em>has</em> become a completely different and much improved animal during the past week. Iâ€™m a happier person too!</p><p>I would like to share with you some of the high-level conclusions Iâ€™ve drawn from this experiment:</p><ul><li>Over the past years, Iâ€™ve had to get used to multi-tasking. Switching to focus mode was quite a challenge, as my reflex is to switch, switch and switch. Judicious application of [pomodori][4], killing of browser windows and general self talkings-to mostly helped. I have it mostly under control, but Iâ€™m sure I could push up my effectivity further with more practice.</li><li>I did manage to work quite efficiently from day one, but only by the end of the second day did I find myself in the right <em>frame of mind</em> for writing this kind of paper. Itâ€™s one of those cases where you can work really hard, but if youâ€™re not in the right frame of mind, youâ€™re not being effective.</li><li>At the beginning of the week, I had configured a vacation email auto-reply, keeping the exact reason for my absence vague. The idea is that I would act as if I were on vacation, that is not responding to email and not taking care of any other work-related issues. Still, I couldnâ€™t help taking care of the bare minimum of important matters, which acted as an extra distraction. I think for any sabbatical, nano to mega, itâ€™s important where exactly you draw the line. During my 2009 sabbatical, I had the strict rule that I could only do normal work-related things during the evenings, which worked quite well.</li><li>By the end of the week I was completely embroiled in interesting article-related issues, with very little else interrupting my concentration. It was refreshing having almost all thought-processes dealing with one topic, instead of bouncing between too many concurrent projects.</li><li>I truly love the process of writing, even if it is scientific writing, which requires a different attitude regarding the structuring of oneâ€™s text and the willingness to rewrite a piece of text as many times as itâ€™s required to get it <em>exactly</em> right. Thereâ€™s nothing like looking at a single short sentence that concisely communicates the thought <em>just so</em>.</li></ul><p><em>On the nerd front (skip to the next paragraph if youâ€™re feeling non-nerdy): eclipse, texlipse, mercurial, jabref and dropbox make for a beautiful LaTeX editing workflow, on Linux and Windows machines. Thereâ€™s nothing like continuous LaTeX builds for the gainful utilisation of the idle and overpowered CPUs in your workstation or laptop.</em></p><p>There will definitely be more weeks like this one just past, and perhaps even a real sabbatical in the not-too-distant future. It is unfortunate that multi-tasking has become so <em>de rigueur</em> in modern life. There is a whole lot to be said for the zen of pouring oneself into just that one important thing.</p><p>[1]: <a href="http://www.google.nl/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=nano-sabbatical#sclient=psy&hl=en&source=hp&q=%22nano-sabbatical%22&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=&pbx=1&fp=368f0808b1fe00fa">http://www.google.nl/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=nano-sabbatical#sclient=psy&hl=en&source=hp&q=%22nano-sabbatical%22&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=&pbx=1&fp=368f0808b1fe00fa</a> &ldquo;link to google search for &ldquo;nano-sabbatical&rdquo;&rdquo;
