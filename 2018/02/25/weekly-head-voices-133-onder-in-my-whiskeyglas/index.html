What a week.

This was a surprisingly amazing end to the week.</p></figcaption></figure><p>What a week.</p><p>It was beautiful to see the whole team step up to the plate and <em>engineer</em> at about 110% throughput (software gets complicated quickly, and there&rsquo;s always one more thing you need to get done before the deliverable is ready), all the while remaining calm and, most importantly, kind.</p><h2 id=pro-tip-special>Pro-tip Special</h2><p>I was of course the lucky winner of the manual-writing sub-project. I love writing code, but there&rsquo;s also something quite satisfying about writing documentation for a technical product. Anyways, there are five tiny but hopefully useful lessons I extracted from this exercise which I would like to present here:</p><ol><li><a href=https://vxlabs.com/2011/08/28/a-windows-console-that-does-not-suck/>I&rsquo;ve lamented the sorry state of the Windows console before</a> (in 2011 to be exact). In a surprise twist, the Windows console still sucks almost 7 years later. At least it&rsquo;s reliable. Anyways, <a href=http://cmder.net/>cmder is a great console replacement</a> which makes some of the stupid go away, somewhat.</li><li>The Windows 10 built-in screenshot facility … wait for it… sucks. When you&rsquo;re writing documentation you need a tool that fits into your workflow. Keyboard shortcut – window or region – image ends up in a directory of your choice. <a href=http://getgreenshot.org/>Greenshot is an open source screenshotting tool</a> that does this with aplomb.</li><li>You need to show a CHM (Windows Help) file to the user of your wxPython application when they hit F1. How hard could it be? Well, you could spend a number of hours trying to come up with a wx-y cross-platform solution, or you could use that time for something else worth your while and just use the <a href=http://docs.activestate.com/activepython/3.3/pywin32/win32help__HtmlHelp_meth.html>Python win32 package to call into the official Windows help API</a>. (cross-platform does work, it&rsquo;s just really ugly)</li><li><a href=http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>Sphinx</a> is a much better tool to write technical manuals than is Markdown and related tools. I briefly considered Markdown because I always have to look up reStructuredText syntax, but fortunately ran into enough other places <a href=http://ericholscher.com/blog/2016/mar/15/dont-use-markdown-for-technical-docs/>warning against using Markdown for documentation</a>. For the record, I prefer orgmode over all of these puny formats in most other cases, but the documentation story of Sphinx with reStructuredText is admittedly much better.</li><li>Start writing the manual as early as possible. It was amazing to see how this helped me to see the software we are designing at a more integrated (user) level. This knowledge was useful in driving more valuable improvements. If you can&rsquo;t explain the flow of some procedure in a manual, that&rsquo;s a good sign the procedure might need some refinement.</li></ol><h2 id=humble-book-bundle-and-rust>Humble Book Bundle and Rust</h2><p>I bought the <a href=https://www.humblebundle.com/books/functional-programming-books>Humble Bundle of (O&rsquo;Reilly) Functional Programming Books</a> for a super affordable $15. I was primarily interested in the <a href=http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920040385.do>Programming Rust book by Blandy and Orendorff</a>, but the other titles on Scala, Clojure, Erlang, Elixir, Haskell, Javascript and general functional programming are welcome additions to my library. Speaking of which, I emailed O&rsquo;Reilly to ask if the books in the bundle could be added to my member library, which they promptly did!</p><p>I have avoided Rust up to now due to natural hype suppression circuitry, and because I grew up with C++, but its zero-overhead memory safety and trustworthy concurrency story makes it hard to ignore any longer. Even although <a href=https://www.quora.com/Which-language-has-the-brightest-future-in-replacement-of-C-between-D-Go-and-Rust-And-Why/answer/Andrei-Alexandrescu>Andrei Alexandrescu once called Rust the language that skips leg day</a>, it&rsquo;s certainly interesting seeing the constructs the language designers have come up to build a really fast compiled language with the lowest number of foot-guns per line of code.</p><p>Anyways, when this blog gets published, you should still have about 22 hours to make use of the <a href=https://www.humblebundle.com/books/functional-programming-books>Humble Bundle deal</a> if you too see something that you like.</p><h2 id=life-is-continuous-practice>Life is continuous practice</h2><p>I wanted to conclude with something that I&rsquo;ve been thinking about recently. It has to do with explicitly treating one&rsquo;s life as <em>continuous practice</em>. As I&rsquo;ve mentioned before on this blog and people much smarter than me have been pointing out since forever, <a href=/2012/01/28/slow-philosophy-weekly-head-voices-64/>goals are no good</a> and (lasting) <a href=/Weekly-Head-Voices-125/#Happy-Not-Happy>happiness is probably not attainable</a>.</p><p>Discarding as many as possible of these sorts of fetters is liberating (you Buddhist), but can seem to leave holes in one&rsquo;s  life narrative. However, treating your life as a super long practice session is an interesting perspective.</p><p>There is also no end point, and no real life goal.</p><p>The only point of the whole exercise (yes, I see what I did there) is to try to improve continuously. Every day, we try to become a little better at our jobs, or at running, or at being a good human, or a partner, or a parent.</p><p>Practice means that you have good days and bad days. It means that you sometimes look back and think that you were a better person then than you are now. Practice means that when you pick one activity, another will temporarily languish until you can make time for it again.</p><p>All of this is ok, because tomorrow you have a whole new day to try again.</p></div><div class=article-toc><h3>Contents</h3><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><ul><li><a href=#pro-tip-special>Pro-tip Special</a></li><li><a href=#humble-book-bundle-and-rust>Humble Book Bundle and Rust</a></li><li><a href=#life-is-continuous-practice>Life is continuous practice</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div><footer class=article-footer><ul class=article-tag-list><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/backyard-philosophy>backyard philosophy</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/functional-programming>functional programming</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/practice>practice</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/python>python</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/restructuredtext>restructuredtext</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/rust>rust</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/rustlang>rustlang</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/sphinx>sphinx</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/windows>windows</a></li><li class=article-tag-list-item><a class=article-tag-list-link href=https://cpbotha.net//tags/wxpython>wxPython</a></li></ul></footer></div><nav id=article-nav><a href=/2018/03/04/weekly-head-voices-134/ id=article-nav-newer class=article-nav-link-wrap><div class=article-nav-title><span>&lt;</span>&nbsp;
